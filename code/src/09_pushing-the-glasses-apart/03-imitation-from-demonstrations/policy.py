"""The policy: LeRobot's ACT, with Diffusion Policy as the second rung.

Neither model is written here. Both are taken from
`LeRobot <https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot>`_, which is Apache-2.0, and
both are fitted from random numbers on demonstrations made inside this
project. **Nothing is downloaded.** LeRobot's ACT starts its vision backbone
from ImageNet weights by default; that default is turned off here, because
the document says the model is fitted from random numbers and a downloaded
backbone would make that untrue.

What this module adds is the three things LeRobot does not decide for you.

**Putting the numbers on one footing.** LeRobot 0.6 leaves normalisation to a
processor pipeline outside the policy. This folder does it here instead, so
the arithmetic is in one place and can be tested without the library. Both
rungs use the same scheme: every action column is mapped onto -1 to 1 from
the range the demonstrations cover, and the picture is scaled to 0-1 and then
centred per colour. Diffusion Policy clips its samples to -1 to 1 while it
denoises, so an action space that already fits inside that is not optional
for the second rung.

**The empty state.** Every LeRobot policy expects a robot state beside the
picture. This one has none: the jaw is parked in the same place between
pushes, so its pose carries nothing the picture does not, and the document is
explicit that what goes in is the view of the table. So the state is passed
as a tensor with no columns. ACT reads the key only to find out which device
it is on; Diffusion Policy needs the feature declared, and a feature of width
zero adds no numbers to the model.

**The chunk is the whole answer.** ``n_action_steps`` is the chunk's full
length for both rungs, because one push is one chunk. Nothing re-plans part
way through.
