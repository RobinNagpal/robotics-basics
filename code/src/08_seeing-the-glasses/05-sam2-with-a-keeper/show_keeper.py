"""Print what the keeper was shown beside what it answered, over one real picture.

This is the claim the document makes for this solution and for no other one in
the set: **the deciding can be explained by printing its inputs beside its
answer.** Every proposal here comes out as eight named measurements, the three
calibrated chances the keeper gave them, the answer that followed, and what the
arithmetic after the keeper then did about it. A person can read that, disagree
with it, and point at the measurement that was wrong.

What the simulator knows is printed beside it, because this is a tool for
arguing with the keeper rather than a scorecard: the answer the truth deserves
comes from the same arithmetic `train.py` labels with. Nothing here is scored
and nothing here is written down; `run.py` does the scoring.

It needs the keeper fitted and SAM 2 downloaded, because these are real
proposals from a real picture and there is no honest way to show them otherwise.
