"""The join between what SmolVLA emits and what this cell's jaw is.

The model's document says somebody has to choose this reading and that the
choice must be held still across solutions 5 and 6. This module is that
choice, written down once. Nothing here is fitted, measured or tuned on the
bench; every number below is read off the model's own configuration or off
the cell's own constants.

**What the model's action space actually is.** ``lerobot/smolvla_base``
declares ``action`` of shape 6 and ``observation.state`` of shape 6, with both
normalised MEAN_STD. The statistics shipped with the checkpoint are three sets
of SO-100 joint angles in degrees, keyed ``so100``, ``so100-blue`` and
``so100-red``. So the six slots are an SO-100 follower arm's five joints and
its gripper: shoulder pan, shoulder lift, elbow flex, wrist flex, wrist roll,
gripper.

**And those statistics do not apply themselves.** They are saved under keys
like ``so100.buffer.action.mean``, while the normaliser looks for ``action``
and ``observation.state``. A key it cannot find is passed through unchanged,
so with the released checkpoint both the normaliser and the un-normaliser are
no-ops: the state goes in as a z-score and the actions come out as z-scores.
Picking one of the three arms to un-normalise against would only compose a
fixed affine map onto what follows, so this module works in the normalised
space the model really speaks and says what one standard deviation means here.

**The reading.** Four of the six slots are used, chosen by what the joint
does on the arm the statistics came from:

- *shoulder pan* swings the whole arm across the bench, so it is the jaw's x;
- *shoulder lift* reaches out and back, so it is the jaw's y;
- *elbow flex* raises and lowers the hand, so it is the jaw's height;
- *wrist roll* turns the hand about the vertical, so it is the jaw's heading.

*Wrist flex* and *gripper* are dropped: this bench holds the jaw level and
closed and offers no way to change either.

**What one standard deviation is worth.** A z-score is not a length, so
something has to set the scale, and only one thing in this solution has both a
metric extent and is seen by the model: the frame of the straight-down
picture. So ``ACTION_SPAN`` standard deviations span that frame exactly. That
is the reading that lets the model put the jaw anywhere it can see and nowhere
it cannot, which is the one property a join has to have if the score is to be
about the model rather than about the join.

It has a price, and it is worth naming because it is not obvious. A waypoint's
position and the jaw's speed are the same number here — the bench consumes
waypoints a fixed period apart, so how far apart they are *is* how fast the
jaw goes. Fixing the box therefore fixes the speed too, and the two cannot be
chosen separately. Nothing is clipped to a gentler speed, because a speed
limit would be a number fitted to this bench and this solution fits nothing.

**The state is the same reading backwards**, so the model is handed its own
pose in the same units it answers in. The checkpoint ships no statistics for
``observation.state`` at all, only for ``action``, so nothing says what scale
that input expects and this is the only self-consistent answer available.
