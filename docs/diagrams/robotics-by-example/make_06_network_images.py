"""Pictures for solution 7 — a segmenter trained from scratch.

Eight figures, each carrying one point of the document:

    06-what-is-asked-for.png          picture in, one probability per pixel out
    06-scratch-or-fine-tune.png       two ways to start, and why one is barred here
    06-the-u-net-shape.png            the down path, the bottleneck, the up path, the skips
    06-where-the-weights-are.png      the parameter arithmetic, and what a fourth level costs
    06-most-pixels-are-table.png      the class imbalance, and what it does to a score
    06-domain-randomisation.png       one scene many ways, and what stays fixed
    06-semantic-against-instance.png  what a per-pixel class map cannot say
    06-confidence-map.png             doubt, and the picture it asks for
    07-hidden-from-above.png          a glass with no pixels, from 450 mm up
    07-hidden-from-the-side.png       a glass with no pixels, from the level view

Run from the project root:

    pixi run python images/generators/problem-2/make_07_images.py

Every number here is arithmetic on channel widths, on image sizes, or on the
discs in these drawings. None of it is a measurement of a trained network, and
the document says so where it quotes these figures.

The last two figures are different in one way that matters. They are not
drawings: every silhouette in them is a real projection of one of the project's
own glass outlines, taken from ``work_cell.glasses.shapes``, through this cell's
own camera. A standing glass is a circle only in its footprint, which neither of
this cell's two views ever sees straight on, so the discs the earlier figures use
would misstate the very thing those two figures are about.
