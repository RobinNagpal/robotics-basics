"""Diagrams for solution 1 — do not drag at all.

Every glass drawn here is one the project's own spawner drew, at a position the
spawner chose, and every rim and foot is measured off that glass's outline
rather than typed in. That matters more in this document than in most, because
the whole argument is about *which* glasses on a particular table are already
grippable, and a picture drawn with invented sizes could be made to say either
answer.
