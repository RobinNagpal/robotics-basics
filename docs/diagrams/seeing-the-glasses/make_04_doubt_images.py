"""Pictures for solution 4 — learned doubt steers the next picture.

Ten diagrams, each carrying one point:

1. the three cases a doubt number has to tell apart, and the one that matters
2. wrong is not the same thing as unusual
3. the five ways to get a doubt number, and what each costs
4. the ordering: geometry generates and vetoes, the model only sorts
5. the loop, drawn as a loop, with the budget as the way out
6. the same seven viewpoints ordered by the rule and by the model
7. what a calibration check looks like, and what a bad one looks like
8. where the seconds go, and what the cap on looks is for
9. how a glass goes missing from a picture taken straight down
10. how a glass goes missing from a picture taken level

The last two draw silhouettes rather than bars, and every one of those
silhouettes is a real projection of one of the project's own glass outlines,
taken from ``work_cell.glasses.shapes`` through the cell's own camera. A
standing glass is a circle only in its footprint, which neither of the cell's
two camera poses ever sees straight on, and drawing it as one is what the first
version of these two pictures got wrong.
