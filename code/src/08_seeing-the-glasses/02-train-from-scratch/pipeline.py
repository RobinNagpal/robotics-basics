"""Solution 2: one picture through TopNet, and its votes gathered into masks.

    one station's picture --TopNet--> per pixel: glass or not, and the way to
                                      the middle of its own glass
    the votes             --tally--> one pile per glass
    the pixels of a pile  --the bench--> a place on the table and a width

At every pixel it calls glass, the network predicts a short arrow pointing at
the middle of that pixel's own glass. Adding the arrow to the pixel's own place
is a vote, one glass's pixels all vote for the same middle, so counting glasses
is counting piles and splitting a blob is asking which pile each of its pixels
voted into. Nothing has to find a boundary, so nothing can get a boundary wrong.

**What this hands back is a boolean mask per glass**, and nothing else. Turning
a mask into a place and a width is `masks_to_glasses`, which is the bench's
arithmetic and the same for all six solutions, so a difference in the scorecard
belongs to how the mask was drawn.

**The kind of glass is handed in and is not used.** The document prescribes a
check here: fit a circle to the pixels of a pile, and refuse a pile whose width
falls outside the range this kind of glass can be. **It is not built**, and what
was measured against building it has since been answered elsewhere. The
measurement: the bench's own exact masks, one station at a time over 20 held-out
spawned scenes, give a footprint outside the kind's range for 66 of 297 glass
sightings, and every one of those 66 reaches the edge of its station's frame, so
a refusal on width inside one picture was throwing away correct answers about
glasses the picture did not hold all of. The answer: `masks_to_glasses` now
reports that fact per report, as `Found.cut_off`, and solutions 1, 4, 5 and 6
refuse on width while reading it. The check could therefore be built here on the
same terms. Nothing has been measured for this solution either way, and until it
is, this file makes no use of the kind.

**`rank_views` and `measure` are not part of problem 2.** The bench stops at a
mask, a place and a width; choosing a viewpoint and reading a glass's profile
from the side are the steps after that, and nothing in `run.py` calls either.
They are kept because
`docs/problem-4/solutions/learned/08-the-learned-pipelines-retrained.md` names
this folder's Ranker and SideNet as two of the parts its pipeline reuses.
