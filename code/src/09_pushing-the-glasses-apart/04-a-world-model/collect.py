"""Push glasses about at random on training tables, and write down what happened.

Each training table gets up to PUSHES_PER_TABLE pushes in a row, the state
after one being the start of the next, so a table's build and settle are paid
once for a dozen examples. A table stops early once anything has fallen over.

The labels come from look(), before and after, the same noisy readings the arm
has at run time. The simulator's own record is never read here.

There are two rounds. The first pushes at random. The second lets the planner
choose, using the model trained on the first, with a share of random pushes
still mixed in. The planner searches thousands of pushes and finds the few
where the model is wrong in its favour; the second round makes exactly those
pushes and writes down what really happened, which is the data that closes
the holes.

    pixi run python collect.py                     # round 1: random pushes
    pixi run python collect.py --planned           # round 2: the planner's own
