"""Which glass to push, from where, which way and how far. Geometry only.

This is the candidate geometry solution 2 ranks. Every landing spot is
checked against the whole
table before anything is scored: room from every other glass, inside the
zone, inside the reach, and a clear path for both the glass and the jaw. Of
what survives, the shortest push wins, because every millimetre pushed is a
millimetre in which something can be knocked.

Nothing here predicts where a glass will end up. The push is aimed, made, and
the next look says where it went.
