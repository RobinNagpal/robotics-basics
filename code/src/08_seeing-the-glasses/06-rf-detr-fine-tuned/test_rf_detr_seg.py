"""The quick checks on everything in this solution that is not the model itself.

No weights, no network and no fine-tune. What is checked here is the labels
written for the package, the split between observed and asserted pixels, the
two prescribed checks, the visible fraction, and that this folder answers the
same interface the other solutions do. A check that needs a download or a
graphics processor is not a check.

**The one that matters most is the trap.** A mask covering a glass's whole
silhouette claims pixels where the camera saw the glass in front of it, and the
depth reading at such a pixel belongs to that other glass. Feeding those in with
the rest moves the reported place onto the glass in front, and nothing else in
the project objects: the mask looks better, the footprint stays round, and the
width stays inside the range the kind allows. So several checks below do nothing
but prove those pixels are named and left out.

Every check whose answer could turn on a glass's proportions runs over all four
kinds and over a family drawn across each kind's range, because a rule that
holds for one glass of a kind and fails for a differently proportioned one is
the failure this project exists to prevent.
