## Introduction

This document explains how to add a trained model to the hardest difficulty in
this problem, which is that an object can be absent from a picture altogether.
The programmed solutions get as far as they can go on their own: they work out
where an object *could* have been hiding and report those places as unsearched.
What they cannot do is say which of those places is **likely** to have something
in it, and that matters because looking costs seconds and there is a budget. By
the end you will understand why this particular model cannot be shown pixels
even in principle, what it is shown instead, why one of its inputs comes from
the problem statement rather than from the camera, and why its most useful
answer is again "I cannot tell".

This document replaces an earlier solution 5, which put a verifier over the
clustered groups to decide whether a group was one object or two. That solution
answered a real question and it still would, but it answered the wrong one for
this problem: a verifier over groups is never consulted about an object that
produced no group. The pattern is kept and pointed at the decision that now
matters.

## The problem this solves

Start from what the programmed side produces, because this solution takes its
input from there and adds nothing to the perception.

[Solution 2](../04_programmed/02_cluster-on-the-table.md) places every object the pictures
contain, and then does something less obvious: it works out which parts of the
table **could not have been seen**. Because the objects that were found have
known positions, widths and heights, the region each one hides is computable.
Any patch of that region large enough to hold the smallest object of the kind is
reported as an **unsearched patch**. The arithmetic that computes that region is
not the same from the two places this cell photographs the table, and the
difference decides what the verifier can usefully be asked; [when the glasses
are completely hidden](#when-the-glasses-are-completely-hidden) works both cases
out.

So the run ends up holding a short list of places, each carrying one honest
statement: *an object of this kind could be standing here, and nothing would
have shown it.*

That statement is exactly true and not very useful on its own, and the reason is
worth being precise about. **It is a statement about possibility, and what the
run needs is a statement about likelihood.** Every scene produces some
unsearched patches, because objects always hide something behind them. Looking
at all of them would spend the whole budget on places that are almost certainly
empty.

### What the rules cannot do with it

It is tempting to sort the patches with a rule — largest first, say, or nearest
the middle of the zone. That is worth doing, and it is worth knowing why it is
not enough.

The evidence bearing on "is something hiding in this patch?" is **several weak
pieces at once**, and none of them is decisive. A large patch can hold an object
but large patches are common. A patch cast by a very tall object is more likely
to be hiding something simply because tall objects hide more table. A patch near
the edge of the zone is less likely to hold anything, because objects are placed
inside the zone and the edges see fewer of them. And a patch that two stations
both failed to see is a different proposition from one that only a single
station missed.

Combining several weak pieces of evidence, none of which is decisive, is the
thing a threshold does worst and a fitted model does best. That is the whole
argument for this solution, and it is the same argument the verifier pattern
always rests on.

### And one piece of evidence that is not in the pictures at all

There is one input worth singling out, because it does not come from the camera
and it is the strongest single clue available.

**The problem statement says there are four to six objects on the table.** So if
the survey found four, then as many as two are unaccounted for, and every
unsearched patch is suddenly much more interesting. If it found six, then
nothing is missing, and every patch can be ignored however large it is.

That is a genuinely useful prior and the programmed side makes poor use of it,
because using it well means weighing "how many are unaccounted for" against "how
plausible is each patch" — which is again the combination of weak evidence that
a rule handles badly.

## The main idea

The main idea is the same division of labour the other hybrids use, and it is
chosen so that the learned part cannot do harm.

**The geometry decides what is possible.** It produces the patches, and it alone
decides whether a patch is large enough to matter. A patch too small to hold the
smallest object of the kind never reaches the model at all.

**The model decides only the order.** It returns, for each patch, a probability
that something is standing in it. Nothing downstream is allowed to treat a low
probability as proof that a patch is empty: the patch stays on the report as
unsearched either way. What the probability changes is which patches the arm
spends its looks on first.

That ordering is worth stating as a rule, because it is what makes the solution
safe to add. **The model can waste a look. It cannot cause a missed object to go
unreported.** A patch the model scores low is still reported as unsearched, and
the run is still honest about it.

## Why this verifier cannot be shown pixels

Every other learned solution in this set has to argue for using measurements
rather than raw pixels, and the argument is usually about cost and transfer.
Here the argument is much shorter, and it is worth pausing on because it is
unusual.

**The thing this model is asked about is defined by the absence of pixels.**

An unsearched patch is a piece of table that no camera could see. There is no
picture of it. There is nothing to crop, nothing to feed a network, and no image
at all in which the answer might be hiding. Whatever the model is shown, it
cannot be the patch, because the patch was never photographed. That is not an
inconvenience to be worked around; it is the definition of the thing.

So the input has to be a description of the patch and its surroundings, built
from what *was* seen. This is a useful reminder about learned components in
general: before asking what a model should be shown, it is worth asking what
evidence exists at all.

One qualification belongs with that argument. The absence of pixels is not the
same absence in the two views. A picture taken straight down at least shows the
outline that does the hiding, and that outline says how far the hiding reaches.
A level picture does not show even that. [When the glasses are completely
hidden](#when-the-glasses-are-completely-hidden) separates the two.

## What the verifier is shown

The input is a handful of measurements, and they fall into three groups. Each
group answers a different kind of question.

**About the patch itself**, there is how much area it has, how many of the
smallest object's footprints would fit inside it, how elongated it is, and how
far it sits from the middle of the zone. Shape matters as well as size, because
a long thin patch of a given area is less likely to hold a round footprint than
a compact one.

**About what casts it**, there is the height and the width of the object whose
outline hides it, how many objects contribute to it, and whether the patch is
cast by an object or by the edge of the frame. Those matter because they say how
the patch came to exist. How much the casting object's height buys it depends on
which of the two views the patch came from, and that is worked out in [when the
glasses are completely hidden](#when-the-glasses-are-completely-hidden).

**About the scene as a whole**, there is how many objects the survey found
against the number the problem allows, how much of the zone is accounted for by
the objects already placed, how many stations failed to see this patch, and how
many looks the budget has left. That first item is the count prior described
above, and it is the input that ties a patch to the rest of the scene rather
than treating it in isolation.

| What the measurement says | Why it bears on the question |
| --- | --- |
| how many of the smallest footprints fit in the patch | a patch that can only just hold one is a weaker candidate than one that could hold three |
| how elongated the patch is | a sliver of a given area is less likely to hold a round footprint |
| how far the patch is from the middle of the zone | objects are placed inside the zone, so the edges hold fewer |
| how tall the object casting it is | seen from above, tall objects hide much more table, so their patches are more often occupied |
| how many objects cast the patch together | a patch several objects conspire to hide is a different proposition |
| whether the frame edge contributes | a patch that is partly off the edge of the picture is not the same as one behind an object |
| how many objects were found, against the number allowed | the count prior: found four of up to six, and two may be missing |
| how many stations failed to see it | one station missing a patch is common; two is not |
| how many looks the budget has left | the ordering matters more when only one look remains |

Every one of those is a length, a count or a ratio. None of them changes when
the arm stands somewhere else, because they are all computed on the table rather
than in a picture.

## Calibration, which is what makes the number mean anything

The verifier returns a probability, and before a threshold may be put on it, one
property has to hold — the same property the other learned solutions need, and
for the same reason.

A probability is **calibrated** when its claims come true about as often as it
says they will. If it says a patch is very likely occupied, then patches it
scores that highly should usually turn out to be occupied. If it says a patch is
probably empty, a fair share of those should turn out to hold something.
Anything else and the ordering is an ordering of an arbitrary number.

Models are very often not calibrated, and the standard repair is not a better
model but a separate, tiny step afterwards: fit the model, then fit a small
function that maps its raw scores onto honest probabilities, using data the
model never trained on. It costs a held-out set and a second of computation, and
it does not make a wrong answer right. It makes the model's *claim* about that
answer honest.

Checking calibration is straightforward here, because the simulator knows
exactly what it spawned. Run the pipeline over a few hundred arrangements,
collect every unsearched patch with the probability the model gave it, and
record whether an object really was standing there. Then compare what was
claimed against what happened.

There is one thing to watch that is specific to this solution. **Occupied
patches are rare**, because most hidden table really is empty. So a model that
says "empty" about everything will score very well on accuracy and be completely
useless. The measurement that matters is therefore not how often the model is
right but whether its high scores are actually enriched for occupied patches —
which is what a calibration plot shows and an accuracy figure hides.

## Two thresholds, and the third answer

As with the other verifiers in this set, there are two thresholds rather than
one, and the gap between them is the point.

**Above the high threshold**, the patch is probably occupied. It goes to the
front of the queue for a look, and if the budget allows only one look, this is
the patch that gets it.

**Below the low threshold**, the patch is probably empty. It is still reported
as unsearched — this is the part that must not be skipped — but it is not worth
an arm movement while anything else is waiting.

**Between the two**, the model says **"I cannot tell"**, and here that answer
has a particularly clean meaning. It means the geometry and the count between
them do not settle whether something is hiding, which is precisely the situation
in which another picture is the only way forward.

The width of the band between the thresholds is a dial with a cost on each side.
Widen it and more patches are treated as worth looking at, which costs arm time
and misses fewer objects. Narrow it and the arm moves less and more objects stay
missed. Because a missed object is the worst failure this problem has and arm
time is merely slow, **the band should start wide**, and be narrowed only when a
scored run shows that the extra looks are finding nothing.

Green marks what this solution adds, blue marks work the programmed solutions
already do, and grey marks the model.

Two things about that flow are worth saying in words.

The first is where the model sits. Everything that can **remove** a patch from
consideration is arithmetic: the size test drops the patches nothing could fit
in, and the covering step decides which camera positions to use. The model only
sorts what is left. So a wrong prediction costs one wasted look, or one look
taken later than it should have been.

The second is that **every patch reaches the report**, whatever the model said
about it. The probability changes the queue and never the record. That is the
property that makes this safe: the worst failure in this problem is a missing
object nobody knows about, and no score the model produces can bring that about.

## When the glasses are completely hidden

The rest of this document takes one situation for granted: an object that
contributes no pixels at all. That is the difficulty this solution exists for,
so it is worth being exact about it, and being exact splits it in two. The cell
photographs the table from two places, and the arithmetic that hides an object
is different in each. Which of the two produced a patch decides what the
verifier can be asked about that patch, so the two are worth separating before
the worked example puts numbers on one of them.

The objects in this cell are drinking glasses, and this section says glass
rather than object throughout, because every number in it was measured on one of
the project's own glass shapes rather than reasoned about in the abstract.

The two places are set out in full in [the cell](../../01_the-cell.md). The survey
view is the camera 450 mm above the table looking straight down, which is what
finds the glasses in the first place. The level view is the camera 120 mm above
the table, standing 380 mm back from one glass and looking level at it, which is
what measures that glass once it has been found. This section calls them looking
straight down and looking level.

### When the camera is looking straight down

Start with why a standing glass does not photograph as its footprint.

The camera is 450 mm above the table and points straight down. Call that height
H, and call the point on the table directly below the lens the nadir. Take a
horizontal slice of a standing glass at height z above the table. That slice is
nearer the lens than the table is, so it is imaged as though it had been scaled
about the nadir by a factor

    k = H / (H - z)

and both the slice's distance from the nadir and its radius are multiplied by
it. At H = 450 mm a slice 225 mm up has k = 2.0, so it appears twice as far from
the nadir as it really is and twice as wide. This project calls that outward
throw splay, and [solution 2](../04_programmed/02_cluster-on-the-table.md) works through its
consequences for the geometry.

Splay is what lets one glass reach over another, and the reaching is worth
following with real numbers.

Take the largest glass this kind allows, 229 mm tall and 103 mm across the rim,
and stand it 200 mm from the nadir. Its rim is thrown out by 2.04, so its
outline does not sit over the glass. The outline runs from 175 mm to 513 mm from
the nadir, and it covers a wedge 29.8 degrees wide.

Now stand the smallest glass the kind allows, 94 mm tall and 84 mm across, 150
mm further out along the same line from the nadir. That 150 mm is the closest
two glasses ever stand in this cell. Because the short glass is short, its own
rim is thrown out by only 1.26. Its whole outline therefore falls inside the
tall glass's, and it contributes not one pixel.

What comes back is a single group, and the circle fitted to it is 103 mm across.
That is the tall glass's own width and it sits inside the kind's range of 65 to
105 mm, so nothing about the group looks wrong. The picture is one legal glass
where there are two.

Three properties of this case are worth having separately, because the second
case below has none of them.

**It needs both closeness and a large difference in height.** The difference in
height is the gap between the two throws above, 2.04 against 1.26. The closeness
shows up in how far out the pair has to stand before the swallowing happens at
all. At 150 mm apart the tall glass has to stand at least 178 mm from the nadir.
At 200 mm apart it has to stand 260 mm out, and at 250 mm apart, 342 mm out,
which needs the camera at one end of the glass zone and the pair at the far
corner of it, because the zone is only 320 by 360 mm.

**The hidden glass is always the shorter one.** The factor k grows with height,
so a shorter glass is never thrown far enough to reach over a taller one,
however close the two stand.

**It depends on where the pair lies about the nadir.** Splay throws both
outlines away from the same point, so what matters is whether the pair lies
along a radius from that point or across one. The same two glasses, the same 150
mm apart, turned across the radius instead of along it, both come back: the
short one's outline clears the tall one's entirely.

**What this leaves the verifier.** The picture carries a geometric hint, which
is the whole difference between this case and the next one. The survey reads
depth, so the tall glass's height is measured and k follows from it by
arithmetic. The outline says the same thing a second way: its outer edge is the
rim thrown out by 2.04 and its inner edge is the base thrown out by almost
nothing, so the ratio between them is the splay factor. Either route gives the
wedge and the stretch of it that nothing could see. For the pair above that
comes to about 43,000 mm² of table.

One of the verifier's inputs is how many of the smallest object's footprints
would fit in a patch, and this patch shows why that input has to be computed
carefully. The smallest glass of the kind has a footprint of 3,300 mm², and
43,000 divided by 3,300 is thirteen. Only six of them actually fit, because
circles do not tile and this patch is a long wedge rather than a compact blob.
The input is meant to say how many glasses could be standing there, so it has to
be the packed count and not the ratio of the areas.

Nothing in the picture says a glass is standing in that patch. What the picture
does say is how much room there is, where the room is and what shape it has, and
those are numbers a model can be fitted on. Keep hold of that, because the next
case does not have it.

![Looking straight down: the tall glass swallows the short one, the survey hands
back one group of one legal width, and the patch left over has a wedge, a reach
and an area that were all read off the
picture](../../../images/robotics-by-example/is-anything-hiding-there/hidden-from-above.png)

### When the camera is looking level

The level view differs in every respect that matters, and the reason is that
nothing is thrown anywhere.

The camera comes down to 120 mm above the table, stands 380 mm back from the
glass it is measuring, and points level. A glass in front of another glass
covers it, and that is the whole mechanism. There is no scaling about a point,
so none of the three conditions above applies.

Take the narrowest glass this kind allows, 197 mm tall and 65 mm across.
Standing 380 mm from the camera it blocks a wedge 9.8 degrees wide. By 231 mm
behind it that wedge is already 105 mm across, which is the widest glass the
kind allows. So from 231 mm behind the near glass outwards, the blocked strip
can hide a glass of any size this cell puts on the table.

Now put the largest glass the kind allows, 229 mm tall and 103 mm across, 300 mm
behind it and in line with the camera. On its own that glass would fill 3,073
pixels of the 320 by 240 frame. Behind the near glass it fills none of them. The
picture the camera returns is identical, pixel for pixel, to the picture it
would return with the far glass taken off the table altogether.

Three things follow, and each is the opposite of what held above.

**Distance between the two glasses buys nothing.** Two glasses of the same size,
one behind the other in line with the camera, hide each other exactly at 150 mm
apart and exactly at 300 mm apart. Hiding here is a question of angle rather
than of separation. So the cell's rule that two glasses never stand closer than
150 mm centre to centre does not remove this case, although it does keep two
glasses standing side by side from merging into one shape.

**The glass that is lost is the further one, not the shorter one.** Being tall
is no protection. In the pair above, the glass that disappears is the taller of
the two by 32 mm and the wider of the two by 38 mm. What decides whether it
disappears completely is how much of the frame the near glass fills, and the
next point is why that is so heavily in the near glass's favour.

**Being nearer is worth more than being large.** The near glass is magnified
relative to the far one by the ratio of their distances from the camera, which
here is 680 over 380, or 1.79. That is why a glass 65 mm across covers one 103
mm across. The near glass may also be shorter than the one it hides, though not
by any amount: of the glasses drawn for this check, the shortest one that still
covers that 229 mm glass completely is 181 mm tall. Below that, the near glass
covers the lower part of the far one and its rim shows above.

The strip itself can still be computed, and it is not small. Over the 360 mm
depth of the glass zone the near glass blocks about 32,500 mm² of table, with
room for four of the kind's smallest footprints. But every one of those numbers
comes from the near glass's position and its size, which the survey and the
measurement between them already knew. The level picture contributed none of
them and could not have, because it is the same picture whether that strip holds
a glass or nothing.

**What this leaves the verifier.** Nothing from that picture. Two pictures that
differ by no pixels cannot carry two different sets of inputs, so no measurement
taken on a level picture can tell a patch with a glass in it from the same patch
empty. Every number the verifier is given about such a patch has to come from
somewhere else, and there are three places it can come from. The survey looked
from above and from three stations, and it may have placed the far glass
already. The count of objects found against the number the problem allows is the
input described [above](#and-one-piece-of-evidence-that-is-not-in-the-pictures-at-all),
and it says how seriously to take the set of patches at all. And the level views
already taken from other angles each blocked a different strip, so between them
they narrow where an unaccounted-for glass can be.

That asymmetry is the reason for separating the two cases. Looking straight
down, the patch has a measured size, a measured shape and a measured cast, so
the verifier's questions about the patch have answers. Looking level, those same
questions have no answers, and the whole weight falls on the group of inputs
about the scene as a whole: how many objects are unaccounted for, how much of
the zone the objects already placed account for, and how many stations failed to
see this patch.

The practical consequence is small and worth writing down before any of this is
trained. One model serves both cases, and it has to, because the patches arrive
in one list. But a patch from a level view arrives with its patch-description
inputs carrying almost nothing, and a model fitted mostly on overhead patches
will learn to lean on exactly those. So the training set has to hold both kinds
in the proportion the run will meet them, and the inputs about the scene as a
whole are the ones that must not be dropped for looking weak on average.

![Looking level: the picture with both glasses standing and the picture with the
far one taken away are the same picture, and the strip of table the verifier is
handed was computed entirely from what was already
known](../../../images/robotics-by-example/is-anything-hiding-there/hidden-from-the-side.png)

## A worked example

The survey has finished. It found **four** objects, and the problem allows four
to six, so as many as two may be unaccounted for. That fact alone raises the
stakes on everything below.

The blind-region arithmetic returns three patches large enough to hold the
smallest object of the kind. The budget allows one extra look.

**The first patch** lies behind the tallest object in the scene, on the far side
from the arm. It is compact rather than elongated, it could hold two of the
smallest footprints side by side, it sits well inside the zone, and two of the
three stations failed to see it. Every piece of evidence points the same way.

**The second patch** is larger in area but a long thin sliver, squeezed between
the edge of the frame and the outline of a middling object. Its area would
suggest it is the best candidate; its shape says a round footprint would not fit
comfortably anywhere in it; and one station saw most of it.

**The third patch** is compact and reasonably large, but it lies right at the
edge of the zone, where objects are rarely placed, and only one station missed
it.

A rule that sorted by area would take the second patch, which is the sliver. A
rule that sorted by how many stations missed it would take the first, which
happens to be right, but would have taken the sliver too if the sliver had been
missed twice.

**What the verifier does** with these is combine the pieces. The first patch
scores high: compact, roomy, central, missed twice, and with two objects
unaccounted for. The second scores low despite its area, because the shape and
the single-station miss both count against it. The third lands in the middle,
because central placement is the one thing it lacks.

So the single look goes to the first patch. The arm moves to a camera position
from which that patch is visible — chosen by the covering step, which also
checks whether the same position happens to see either of the others — takes the
picture, and the clustering runs again over everything.

**Both endings are worth following.** If an object is standing in that patch, it
is found, the count reaches five, and the two remaining patches are re-computed
from the new set of objects, which usually shrinks them. If the patch turns out
to be empty, that is not a wasted look: the patch leaves the unsearched list,
the count still stands at four, and the remaining patches become *more*
suspicious rather than less, because there are still two objects unaccounted for
and fewer places left for them to be.

That second ending is the one that shows why the count prior is worth having. A
verifier that looked at each patch in isolation would learn nothing from an
empty result. One that knows how many objects are unaccounted for learns
something from every look, whichever way it goes.

## Where it is strong and where it breaks

The strengths come from the narrowness of the job and from where it sits.

It answers one question over a handful of inputs, so it needs few examples,
trains in seconds, and can be inspected by printing its inputs beside its
answer. Its labels are free, because the simulator knows exactly what it spawned
and therefore knows whether each patch was occupied. It cannot cause the failure
this problem cares most about, because every patch reaches the report whatever
it scores. And it **degrades to the programmed solutions**: with no model at
all, the patches are looked at in whatever order the geometry suggests, which is
exactly what solutions 2 and 3 do together.

The weaknesses divide into what it cannot see, what is hard about training it,
and whether it is worth building at all.

What it cannot see is inherited. It reasons about patches computed from the
objects that were **found**, so an object hidden behind an object that was
itself hidden lies outside its reach entirely. No amount of training fixes that,
because the patch it would need to be asked about was never computed.

What is hard about training it is the rarity problem described under
calibration. Occupied patches are the minority, so the training set is
unbalanced, accuracy is a useless measure, and the model will drift towards
saying "empty" unless the loss and the scoring both account for that.

Whether it is worth building at all is the honest question, and the answer for
this cell is **probably not yet**. Solution 2 measured how often objects are
actually hidden from every station, and the answer was never: the three survey
stations see every object between them. So in this cell the unsearched patches
are nearly always empty, the geometry's own ordering is good enough, and a model
would be sorting a list that rarely matters.

What would change that is any of three things: dropping a survey station,
widening the zone, or letting the objects stand closer together. All three make
hidden objects real rather than theoretical, and at that point the ordering
starts deciding whether objects are found. The thing to do before building this
is therefore to **measure how often a patch is occupied**, exactly as the
earlier solution 5 said to measure the size of its ambiguous band first.

## Where the idea comes from

The pattern here is old and well named, and three ideas sit behind it.

### Verifiers and cascades — a cheap exact test first

Arrange the work in order of cost, so that a cheap exact method handles
everything it can and an expensive or learned one is consulted only on what is
left. When the second stage checks the first, it is usually called a
**verifier**; when it simply runs on the survivors, a **cascade**. The
best-known example is the Viola–Jones face detector, which made real-time
detection possible by rejecting almost every part of an image in a handful of
arithmetic operations.

This is used wherever there is a large easy majority and a small hard minority.
It is rarely right when the cheap stage cannot be made both fast and safe,
because whatever the first stage wrongly discards, no later stage ever sees.
Here the first stage is the patch-size test, and it is safe because it is exact:
a patch too small to hold the smallest object genuinely cannot hold one.

### Classification with a reject option — a model allowed to decline

Instead of forcing every input into a class, allow a third answer: decline, and
hand the case to something else. Here the something else is an arm movement. The
rule for when to decline is old and simple (Chow,
[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.1970.1054406), 1970): decline when the best
probability falls below a threshold set by the relative cost of an error and a
refusal.

It is used wherever being wrong is expensive and a fallback exists, and it is
rarely right where declining simply means failing. Here declining means looking,
which is cheap, so the reject option earns its place easily.

### Priors, and why the count matters

The last idea is the most general and the least often used well. **A prior is
information you had before the measurement**, and combining it correctly with
the measurement is what turns a reading into a belief.

The count in this problem — four to six objects — is a prior of exactly that
kind. It says nothing about any individual patch and everything about how
seriously to take the set of them. Found six and the patches are irrelevant.
Found four and two objects are somewhere.

The general lesson is worth carrying: when a learned component seems to need
more evidence than the sensors provide, it is worth asking what the
**specification** already guarantees. Here the specification supplied the
strongest single input the model has.

## Where it sits among the other solutions

This solution sits on top of two programmed ones and adds nothing to either.
Solution 2 finds the objects and computes the patches. Solution 3 covers the
patches with camera positions and performs the movement. This solution only
decides which patches are worth the covering step's attention first.

Against the other learned solutions, the comparison is about which difficulty
each one attacks. Solutions 7 and 8 replace the perception itself, and neither
of them can help here, because a model that labels pixels has no pixels to
label. Solutions 4 and 6 order candidate viewpoints for a **doubtful object**,
which is a different request from a **suspect place**. This solution is the only
learned component in the set pointed at the difficulty the problem statement
says to watch hardest.

Which makes its honest position slightly awkward and worth stating plainly: it
is aimed at the most important difficulty, and it is also the one whose value
most depends on a measurement nobody has taken yet.
