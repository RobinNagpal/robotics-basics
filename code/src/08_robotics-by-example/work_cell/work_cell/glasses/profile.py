"""The width of a glass at every height, and the features found in it.

This is what the arm has instead of a table of measurements. A side-on picture
of a glass gives its outline, and reading the width off that outline at every
height gives a Profile. Everything the arm needs to know about a glass it has
never seen is worked out from this one list of numbers.

The features are deliberately described by shape rather than by size. "A local
minimum in width with wider parts above and below" is a stem on every stemmed
glass ever made. "Nine millimetres across, ninety millimetres up" is a stem on
exactly one.

Plain numpy, no ROS, so the whole module can be tested directly.

# How far off vertical a wall can lean and still be worth gripping.
#
# Two flat pads on a slope push the glass along that slope; on a vertical wall
# they just press. But a soft pad does not need a perfectly vertical wall — it
# squashes to fit. The figure that matters is how much it can squash across its
# own height, which for the silicone pads on this gripper is a little over a
# millimetre over a pad about 12 mm tall. That is atan(1.2 / 12), near enough
# six degrees.
#
# Setting it tighter than the pad can actually manage has a specific cost:
# every short glass with a mould taper gets refused, because a 10% taper over
# 55 mm of height is already more than two degrees. That is a real glass and
# the gripper can hold it perfectly well.
#
# This is a property of the gripper's pads, not of any glass, which is why it
# lives here rather than in a glass record.

# The pads are what decide this too. What a pad cares about is whether the wall
# is flat across the pad's own height; the wall between two rows a pixel apart
# is not a thing the gripper can feel, and not a thing a camera can measure
# either.
#
# Taking it row by row instead is not merely noisy, it is wrong in one
# direction. A measured width is quantised to whole pixels, so on a gently
# sloping wall it stays flat for several rows and then jumps. Row to row, most
# of the wall reads as exactly vertical and the rest as a cliff — a cone comes
# out straight, and the steps chop the upright runs too short to grip. Over a
# pad's height the same wall reads as the slope it is.
