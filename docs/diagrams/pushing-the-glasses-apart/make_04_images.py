"""Diagrams for solution 4 — predict the slide with pushing mechanics.

Every glass drawn here is built by the project's own builder at proportions
drawn from ``KIND_RANGES["tapered_glass"]``, so no size on any of these
pictures was chosen to make a picture work. The mechanics is computed rather
than sketched: the load under the foot is solved for, the limit surface is the
real ellipse, and each push is integrated rather than drawn as an arc.

    pixi run python ../docs/diagrams/pushing-the-glasses-apart/make_04_images.py

Everything the document quotes is printed by ``report()`` at the end, so a
number in the prose can be checked against a number on the terminal.
