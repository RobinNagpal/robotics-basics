"""Diagrams for solution 10 — amodal masks for the hidden part.

Seven pictures, each carrying one step of the argument: what modal and amodal
masks are, why a mask cut short gives a footprint that is wrong in a way every
check accepts, where the amodal training label comes from, how little of the
model changes, why the extra pixels are a prediction rather than a measurement,
how to score such a prediction, and the one case the whole idea cannot reach.

Every silhouette here is a real overhead projection of one of the shared cast of
glasses in ``diagram_style``, built from ``splay_circles``, and every pixel is
assigned to a glass by comparing heights along the ray, so a glass covers
another only when the geometry says it does. The numbers in the labels are
measured off those rasters rather than typed in: the visible fractions, the
areas, the fitted circles, the overlaps and the errors are all computed when
this script runs.
