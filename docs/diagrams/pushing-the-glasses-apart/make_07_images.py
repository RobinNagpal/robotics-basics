"""Diagrams for solution 7 — a learned change-verifier.

Every glass drawn here is one the project's own code drew. Two sources, and
nothing else: ``family("tapered_glass", HOW_MANY, SEED)`` from
``work_cell.glasses.shapes`` for the measurements across the kind's range, and
``scene(seed)`` from ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/bench/bench.py`` for the crowded tables, because
that is the authoritative generator for this problem. No size in this file was
chosen to make a picture work.

A toppled glass is drawn as the real outline laid over, not as a rectangle. The
lean is a parameter, so the same arithmetic draws a glass upright, a glass at
the examiner's own STANDING_TILT_DEG, and a glass flat on its wall. A tapered glass
lying down rests on one slant line of its own wall, so its axis is tilted, and
the tilt changes both the length it covers on the table and how tall it stands.
