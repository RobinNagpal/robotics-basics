"""Diagrams and measurements for solution 3 — plan, feel, look again.

Solution 3 is built. ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/01-one-fixed-nudge/plan.py`` chooses the pushes and
``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/bench/bench.py`` makes the tables and the physics, so this script
does not invent either. It mirrors both:

* ``scene(seed)`` here reproduces ``bench.scene(seed)`` exactly — the same kind,
  the same count, the same outlines and the same positions. A throwaway script
  under ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/01-one-fixed-nudge`` checked that against the real thing on 80
  seeds and found no disagreement at all; the check is quoted in the document.
* ``slides``, ``along``, ``choose`` and ``shortfall`` here are the same
  arithmetic as ``plan.py``, in millimetres instead of metres.

The mirror exists for one reason. ``bench.py`` imports MuJoCo, which is not in
the root environment, and every diagram generator in this repository has to run
from the project root under that environment. Anything that needs the physics
rather than the geometry is therefore *recorded* rather than recomputed:
``STORY`` below holds a real run of ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/01-one-fixed-nudge`` on table 10001,
and ``SCORED`` holds the numbers from its ``results.json``.

No glass size is written down here. Every outline comes from
``work_cell.glasses.shapes.draw`` inside its kind's declared range, which is
what ``bench.scene`` calls.
