"""Solution 1: the glasses in one picture, by grouping dots on the table.

Every pixel that stands above the table becomes a point in the room. The
points are then grouped where they stand on the table, not where they fall in
the picture. Two glasses can overlap in a picture when the camera is in line
with both; on the table they are plainly apart.

**What this hands back is a boolean mask per glass**, and nothing else. Turning
a mask into a place and a width is `masks_to_glasses`, which is the bench's
arithmetic and the same for all six solutions, so a difference in the scorecard
belongs to how the mask was drawn. The only number this file contributes is
which pixels fed which group.

**The masks are a consequence of the grouping rather than a drawn outline.** No
step here ever asks where a glass ends: one step decides which pixels stand
above the table and a quite different step decides which of those belong
together, so the edge of every mask was fixed before the grouping began. What
follows is in [the document](../../docs/02-segment-glasses/solutions/01-rules-on-the-table.md):
the masks lose the band at the base of a glass, where the wall is too close to
the table to be told from it, and they almost never claim a pixel that is not
glass.

**The kind of glass decides what a group's width is allowed to be.** A circle is
fitted to each group, and the width it gives is held against the range of
footprints this kind of glass can have, which the cell is told. A group too wide
for one glass of the kind is not one glass, so it is split in two with k-means —
and **the same question is then asked of each part**, so a part still too wide is
split again. The repetition is the point: the bench's crowded family stands
three glasses to a line, so one split into two necessarily leaves a part holding
two. **The fitted width decides only the split.** The width that goes into the
record is the bench's, measured from the pixels handed back.

**A group too narrow for the kind is refused only when the whole of it was in
frame.** At the cell's own survey height one picture does not hold the glass
zone, so a glass near the edge of a station's frame shows part of its footprint
and a circle fitted to that part is small through no fault of the grouping. That
was measured on masks that cannot be improved on: the bench's own exact masks,
one station at a time over 20 held-out spawned scenes, give a footprint outside
the kind's range for 66 of 297 glass sightings, and every one of those 66
reaches the frame edge. So `masks_to_glasses` says whether the mask a report was
measured from reached the picture's edge, and the narrow refusal reads it.

**The wide refusal does not read it**, because the two sides of the range mean
different things here. A frame that cuts a patch short takes dots away, which
makes the circle round it smaller. Over 20 held-out spawned scenes, where the
layout keeps every glass 150 mm from the next, 73 groups holding one glass read
too narrow and every one of them reached the frame edge, against 4 that read too
wide. Over 20 crowded scenes every one of the 72 groups that held more than one
glass read too wide. So a narrow reading is about the view and a wide one is
about the grouping, and the wide one is the merge this check exists to catch.

The document also names a third number from the fit, the residual, as a measure
of how well a circle explains a group's dots. None of the four outcomes it
prescribes uses the residual, so nothing here computes one.
