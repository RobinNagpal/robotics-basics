"""What MoveIt is told about the world.

MoveIt plans against its own picture of the cell, not against Gazebo. Without
this the planner would sweep the arm through the table, through the rack, and
through the glasses standing beside the one it is reaching for.

Every glass is described to the planner as a plain cylinder: as wide as the
glass is at its widest, and as tall as the glass is tall. That is deliberately
bigger than the glass really is, because a cylinder that contains the glass can
never let the arm through a place the glass actually occupies. Planning a
little conservatively costs a few refused approaches; planning optimistically
costs broken glass.

Before the arm reaches for a glass, that glass is taken out of the scene,
because the planner will not let the fingers enter a space it believes is
solid. Once the glass is held it goes back in, attached to the gripper, so that
the turn and the carry are planned with it in hand.
