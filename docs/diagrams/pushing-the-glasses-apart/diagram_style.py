"""Shared look and shared arithmetic for the pushing-the-glasses-apart diagrams.

One module so that eleven separately written scripts produce pictures that sit
beside each other without looking like eleven different documents. Import it,
call ``new``/``save``, and use the colour names rather than literals.

    from diagram_style import GLASS, GOOD, INK, MUTED, WARN, bare, new, save

Every script in this folder writes into ``docs/images/pushing-the-glasses-apart/<doc-name>/`` and is run from
the project root:

    pixi run python ../docs/diagrams/pushing-the-glasses-apart/make_01_images.py

The second half of this module is the arithmetic problem 3 turns on: whether a
pushed glass slides or tips, how much clear room a gripper needs round a glass,
and which pairs on a table are too close to grip. It lives here rather than in
each script because eleven documents disagreeing about when a glass topples
would be worse than eleven documents that look different.

Nothing here is a glass measurement. The sizes below are the *kind's* declared
range, taken from ``glasses/shapes.py``, which is a rule about what may be
drawn and not a fact about any one glass.
