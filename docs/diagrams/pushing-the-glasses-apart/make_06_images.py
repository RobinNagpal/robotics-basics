"""Diagrams for solution 6 — geometry generates, a model ranks.

Everything drawn here is measured against this repository's own reference
implementation of problem 3, not against anything invented for a picture:

- ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/bench/bench.py`` holds ``scene(seed)``, the crowded tables both
  approaches are scored on, and ``has_room``, the project's own room test;
- ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/01-one-fixed-nudge/plan.py`` holds the candidate pushes and the rule
  that ranks them, which is the "geometry generates" half of this solution
  already written;
- ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/01-one-fixed-nudge/results.json`` and ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/04-a-world-model/results.json``
  hold what each scored on the fifty held-out tables.

``bench.py`` imports MuJoCo, which is not in the root environment, so nothing
here imports it and this file still runs from the project root. The population
numbers in ``SWEEP``, ``ORDERS`` and ``ORACLE`` were measured instead by a
throwaway script run in the environment that does have MuJoCo:

    cd code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/01-one-fixed-nudge && pixi run python <script>

It walked ``bench.scene`` over test seeds 10000 to 10049 — the same fifty
held-out tables ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/01-one-fixed-nudge/run.py`` is scored on — calling
``plan.along`` for every heading of every crowded glass and ``bench.has_room``
on every destination, and it carried the run forward on the first thirty of
them under four different choosing rules. The script is not committed because
it belongs to that environment rather than this one; every number it produced
is named in the document beside the claim it supports, and the worked example
below is re-derived here from first principles as a check that the two have not
drifted apart.

The worked example is different. Only its glasses' *positions* are written
down, because a position is a layout and not a measurement of a glass. The
glasses themselves are redrawn here from the project's own drawer at the same
seed, exactly as ``bench.scene`` draws them, so no glass's size appears in
this file. ``check_the_example`` re-runs the room test on what it redrew and
prints the result, so a silent drift between this file and the examiner shows up
as a failed check rather than as a wrong picture.

# up, so JAW_TOP and not LOWEST_GRIP is the height a glass is really pushed at.
#
# plan.py checks the tipping limit at both ends of the range it is willing to
