"""Diagrams for solution 8 — a learned early-abort.

Everything drawn here is computed, not sketched. The glass outlines come from
``work_cell.glasses.shapes``, drawn at sizes inside the tapered kind's declared
range, and the mass, the height of the centre of mass and the moment of inertia
come from ``work_cell.glasses.spawn``, which is the same arithmetic the
simulator is handed when it spawns the glass. No size of any glass is written
down in this file.

Two of these pictures show a force against time. Those curves are **computed
rather than recorded from a run**, and the pictures say so on their face. The
model is one line: a glass tipping about
the leading edge of its foot needs a horizontal push at world height ``h`` of

    F = m g r sin(theta_c - theta) / h

where ``r`` is the distance from that edge to the centre of mass and
``theta_c`` is the rotation that brings the centre of mass over the edge. It
falls to zero at ``theta_c`` because the glass is then balanced and needs no
help. A sliding glass instead needs ``mu m g``, which does not change.
