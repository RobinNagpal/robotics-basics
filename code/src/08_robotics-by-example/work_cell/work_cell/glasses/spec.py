"""What the arm is told about glasses in advance.

One rule governs this file, and it is worth stating before anything else:

    This file may hold rules and limits. It may not hold the size of any glass.

"Hold the narrowest part below the bowl" is true of every stemmed glass ever
made. "Hold it 90 mm up" is true of exactly one. The first is a rule and
belongs here; the second is a measurement and is worked out at run time from
what the camera saw.

Every number below is either a fraction of a glass's own height, or a limit
belonging to the gripper. Swap every glass in the building for a different size
and nothing here changes.

No ROS and no numpy, so this can be read and tested on its own.
