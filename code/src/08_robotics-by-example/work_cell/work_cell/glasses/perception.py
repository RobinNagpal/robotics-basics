"""Turning a side-on picture of a glass into a measured profile.

The wrist camera is moved to one side of a glass and takes one picture.
Something upstream says which pixels are glass. This module turns that mask
into widths in millimetres.

Two things make it possible.

A drinking glass is a solid of revolution, so the outline seen from any side is
the full shape: the width on screen at some height *is* the diameter there.

And the glass stands on the table, whose height is known. The arm chose how far
back to stand, so it knows how far away the glass is without ever needing a
depth reading of the glass itself. Distance is what turns an angle into a
length.

Plain numpy, no ROS, so the whole module can be tested with drawn masks.
