"""The workflow.

For every glass on the table:

1. move the wrist camera to a side view and measure it, because nobody has
   told the arm how big it is;
2. work out where to hold it and how wide the fingers must open, by applying
   that kind's rule to what was measured;
3. pick it up, find out what it really weighs, and adjust the squeeze;
4. turn it 180 degrees so the mouth points down;
5. lower it into a free slot until the rim touches, and let go.

This module is the only one that knows what order things happen in. Everything
it calls is a capability that does not know it is part of a sequence, which is
what lets those parts be tested on their own.

Two things are worth knowing before reading it.

The arm is never told the size of a glass. Every number it uses about one is
measured during the run, and a glass it cannot measure is left standing.

A glass left standing is a result, not a failure. Broken glass leaves shards
and an arm that will carry on moving through them, so anything doubtful ends
with the glass back on the table and a line in the report.
