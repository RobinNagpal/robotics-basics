"""Solution 6: RF-DETR-Seg, fine-tuned here, on one class, with two targets.

The model is a transformer that detects and segments in one pass. It carries a
fixed number of **queries**, each of which either reports one glass or reports
nothing, and each query's mask is computed over the whole picture rather than
inside a rectangle. Two things follow and both matter here. Two glasses whose
outlines join occupy two slots from the beginning, so nothing has to divide a
joined region. And **there is no rectangle for a mask to escape**, so a mask is
free to cover more of a glass than the picture shows.

**The second rung uses that freedom.** ``amodal`` in ``fit`` chooses what each
mask is trained against: the pixels the camera can see of a glass, or the
glass's whole silhouette. Nothing else about the model changes — not its shape,
not its last layer, only what the masks are compared with. That is the whole
difference between the two rungs.

**The trap, which is the one thing here most easily got wrong.** A mask covering
a whole silhouette claims pixels where the camera saw some other glass's
surface. The depth reading at such a pixel belongs to that other glass, so
feeding it into the shared arithmetic drags the computed place across the gap
and onto the glass in front. With exact masks the bench measured the cost: 46 mm
out against 12 mm. So every mask is split into its **observed** part and its
**asserted** part before the arithmetic runs, and ``masks_to_glasses`` is handed
the asserted pixels and leaves their readings out.

**How the split is read off the answer.** A camera looking straight down sees a
glass's outline thrown outwards from the point below it, so of two glasses whose
outlines overlap, the one standing **nearer that point** is the one in front.
Every pixel two reports both claim therefore belongs to whichever of them stands
nearer the point below the camera, and the other report must call that pixel
asserted. Nothing in this needs the truth: the places come from the pixels each
report holds alone, and the point below the camera comes from the camera's own
pose, which the cell knows from its joint encoders. The one case it cannot see
is a glass hidden by something the model never reported, and there is nothing in
the picture to work that out from either.

**Two checks, each of which can only refuse.** The width must lie inside the
range this kind of glass allows, **unless the picture ran out before the glass
did**, which `_width_refuses` says why. And the asserted part must lie where the
camera could not see: a mask claiming a glass continues across a patch with a
clear view of it, where the reading comes back off something standing nowhere
near this glass, is contradicting a direct observation. A glass failing either
is reported as doubtful rather than placed, and the reason says as well whether
the mask runs off the edge of the frame.

**The visible fraction travels with every report**, because every consumer
further down has its own tolerance for how much of an answer was asserted and
none of them can apply it once the two parts have been merged.

**The kind of glass is handed in with the picture**, as the problem says the
cell is told it. What it settles here is the range of footprints a glass could
have, and no glass's size is written down anywhere.

**The camera belongs to data.py.** Nothing here chooses a viewpoint, so all six
solutions are guaranteed the same pictures.
