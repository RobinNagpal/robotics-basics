"""Fit whatever the chosen solution fits, and save it beside the borrowed weights.

    pixi run python train.py --solution sam --scenes 20
    pixi run python train.py --solution maskrcnn
    pixi run python train.py --solution amodal

The three commands are the same command. That is the point of this file: a
solution here is a module to call and the masks to train against, and those two
facts are all of what this file knows about any of the three. Which model gets
loaded, what is fitted, how long it takes and what it writes belong to the
module named in the table below, so `sam`, `maskrcnn` and `amodal` are
indistinguishable from here and stay comparable for that reason.

The table is the only place in this folder that knows the three names apart.
Nothing else anywhere may branch on which solution is running; a module is told
what to do, not who it is. `maskrcnn` and `amodal` name one module on purpose.
They are solutions 9 and 10, which differ only in what their masks are trained
against, so the difference between them is one flag in the table.

Every solution is fitted through the same three calls:

    fit(examples, *, amodal, save) -> what was fitted, to print
    load(save) -> a finder
    finder.find(picture, kind) -> the glasses in it, and the doubts

A solution is handed a picture and the kind of glass on the table, which the
cell is told, and never the list of glasses behind the picture. That is what
stops a solution reaching the truth at test time.

The scenes come from data.py, which only ever hands out seeds below the held-out
line, so training cannot reach a scene that `run.py` will score on.
