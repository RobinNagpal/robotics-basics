"""The three learned parts, and how each is trained.

1. TopNet   — overhead depth picture in, per pixel: is it glass, and which way
              is the middle of its glass. Pixels that vote for the same middle
              are one glass, which is what separates two glasses that touch in
              the picture.
2. Ranker   — the numbers in viewpoints.FEATURES in, the chance this side
              picture is unspoiled out. It only orders places geometry allowed.
3. SideNet  — side depth picture in, the glass's height and its width at 16
              fractions of that height out.

All small enough to train on a laptop CPU in minutes from 200 pictures.
