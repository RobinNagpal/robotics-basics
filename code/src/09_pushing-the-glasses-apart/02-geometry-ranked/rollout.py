"""Make one candidate push on the bench and write down what it did.

This is the label, and it costs nothing to collect: the bench measures the
table after every push in any case. It has two parts, as the document asks.
The first is how much clear room the whole table gained, so that a push which
frees one glass by crowding another is not paid for half of its effect. The
second is whether anything toppled, which makes a push the worst candidate
there is.

The label is read from the simulator's own record, which the bench allows as
a training label on training tables and nowhere else. Nothing that decides a
push at run time reads it: the eight inputs come from ``look()``, carrying the
camera's error, exactly as they will when the arm is working. The camera's own
reading of the same outcome is kept beside the label, because the difference
between the two is how much of a group's spread a run could even perceive.

Candidates are tried from a saved state rather than on a rebuilt table. The
table is the same table either way, and restoring it is thousands of times
cheaper than building it, which is what makes a few thousand labelled pushes
a matter of minutes.
