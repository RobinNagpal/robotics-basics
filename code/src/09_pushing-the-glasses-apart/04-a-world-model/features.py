"""What the model is shown about a push, and what it is asked to predict.

Everything is in the push's own frame: ``along`` is the way the jaw moves,
``across`` is to its left. A push to the north and the same push to the east
are one example, not two, because the table's friction is the same everywhere.

The inputs are only what the arm has: the camera's readings of every glass
(bench.Seen) and the push it is thinking of making. No friction, no tipping
rule, no mass. Whether a push slides or topples a glass is for the model to
learn from the pushes it has seen.
