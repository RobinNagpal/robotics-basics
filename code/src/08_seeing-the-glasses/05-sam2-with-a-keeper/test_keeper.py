"""The quick checks on the parts both rungs of this solution stand on.

No weights and no network: what is checked here is the shading, the camera the
two rungs share, the split between training and held-out scenes, the two kinds
of mask, the arithmetic that turns a mask into a place and a width, the
keeper's own arithmetic and its two thresholds, and that both rungs really do
answer one interface.

Every check that involves a glass runs over a family of them rather than one,
because a rule that holds for one glass of a kind and fails for a differently
proportioned one is the failure this project exists to prevent.
