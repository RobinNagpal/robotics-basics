# Problem 3 — push the glasses apart

[Problem 2](../../08_seeing-the-glasses/02_the-problem/01_what-is-asked-for.md) has ended. The arm knows which
pixels are which glass and where each one stands. Some of them are standing too
close together for the gripper to get round one without fouling its neighbour.

The arm has to **move them apart by dragging them across the table**. Not by
lifting them. Dragging is the whole point of the problem.

## Why dragging and not lifting

Because lifting is the thing that is not available yet, and the reason is
circular:

- To lift a glass, the fingers have to close on it in a chosen place.
- To choose that place, the arm needs the glass's profile.
- To measure the profile, it needs a side-on photograph from 380 mm away.
- To take that photograph, it needs a viewpoint that is not blocked — which is
  exactly what the crowding has taken away.

Dragging breaks the circle because it needs almost nothing. A push needs a
contact and a direction. It does not need to know the glass's height, its shape,
its weight, or where its stem is. All it needs is where the glass stands and
how wide its base is, and problem 2 already produced both.

## What is on the table

The same glasses as problem 2 — four to six, one known kind, upright and opaque
— except that some of them are close together. Close enough that the numbers in
the next section bite.

## What goes in

Every answer to this problem is given exactly this and nothing more.

**What the camera work hands over.** For each standing glass: where it stands,
how tall it is, how wide it is at its widest and at its foot. Every reading
carries problem 2's measured error, so nothing here is exact.

**A view of the table from the top**, for the answers that read pictures rather
than readings.

**What the jaw felt on the last push.** The jaw comes down behind a glass,
feels forward until it touches, pushes, and backs off, and it reports what it
felt on the way. That force reading matters more than it looks, and the section
on friction below says why.

**Nothing else.** In particular, no answer may read the simulator's record of
what it placed, or the friction it is using. Both exist, and both are how the
run is marked afterwards.

This matters more here than in the other problems, because six quite different
methods are compared on this question, and a comparison only means something
when the question was identical. The [test bench](../02_the-test-bench.md) hands exactly
this to every one of them.

## What must come out

**A jaw trajectory**, and then another, until the table is done or the budget
is spent.

Some answers think in whole pushes — a contact, a direction, a distance — and
the bench expands one of those into a trajectory through a macro it owns. Other
answers produce the trajectory directly, a short run of waypoints at a time.
Both are allowed, and the bench treats them alike, because **what is scored is
the table afterwards rather than the push that changed it**. That is the only
way a push described by three numbers and a push described by fifty waypoints
can be compared at all.

**And a refusal, where one is honest.** A glass that tips before it slides, or
has nowhere clear to go, is reported with the reason rather than attempted. A
refusal is a result.

## The gap that matters is not the gap between the glasses

![The room a gripper needs round a glass](../../images/pushing-the-glasses-apart/what-is-asked-for/problem-3-the-room-a-gripper-needs.png)

Two glasses with a centimetre of daylight between them are not touching. A
person would call them separate. The gripper cannot pick up either of them, and
the reason is that the gripper is not a point.

To close on a glass, the open jaw has to be **around** it: a finger either side,
each finger a little thicker than nothing, with the jaw opened wider than the
glass before it closes. Add that up from the glass's middle outwards and it
comes to about **70 mm of clear room in every direction**.

That room is measured to the **neighbour's edge**, not to its middle, and the
consequence is easy to miss: the test is **not symmetric**. A narrow glass
standing beside a wide one is crowded before the wide one is, because the wide
one's rim reaches further into the gap. So a method that compares distances
between middles will call a pair fine when one of them cannot be gripped.

So there are three different distances in play and they are easy to confuse:

| | What it is | Roughly |
| --- | --- | --- |
| glasses touching | the failure problem 2 could not even see | the two rims meet |
| glasses grippable | the jaw fits round one of them | 70 mm clear of the neighbour's **edge** |
| glasses measurable | a clear line of sight from 380 mm back | depends on the angle |

Problem 3's job is to get every glass over the second line. The third is
problem 2's, and moving a glass changes it too.

## How low the push has to be, and why it is a property of the glass

![Push low or it topples](../../images/pushing-the-glasses-apart/what-is-asked-for/problem-3-push-low-or-it-topples.png)

A pushed object either slides or tips over, and which one happens is decided by
where it is pushed. Push near the base and it slides. Push near the rim and it
tips.

The dividing line is not a matter of taste. Pushing at height `h` on an object
whose base is `2a` across, standing on a table it rubs against with friction
`μ`, the object slides while

    h  <  a / μ

and tips above it. Both ends of that fraction matter. A wide foot at the
slippery end of the plausible friction range leaves room to push well above
anything the gripper could reach, so such a glass is easy. A narrow foot at the
grippy end leaves less room than the gripper can reach without fouling the
table — and a glass like that cannot be pushed safely at all, so the only
correct answer for it is to refuse.

**The height to compare against is the top edge of the jaw, not the bottom.**
The middle of the jaw rides as low as the gripper goes, 50 mm, but the jaw is
30 mm tall, so its top edge is at 65 mm. A glass that is wider higher up meets
that top edge before anything else touches it, and the tapered kind is wider
higher up by definition. So `h` in the rule above is 65 mm for these glasses,
not 50. The difference is not a detail, and it bites hardest on exactly the
kind that flares most: measured across the tapered kind at the friction this
cell's bench actually uses, checking at the jaw's middle calls about seven
glasses in ten safe to push, while checking at its top edge calls only about a
quarter safe. The three kinds that flare less barely move. Every one of the
mistakes is in the direction that topples a glass.

Three things follow, and they are the shape of the problem:

**The push height has to be worked out per glass**, from its measured base
width, not chosen once. This is the same pattern as everywhere else in the
project: compute what the measurement allows rather than assuming a tolerance.

**Some glasses cannot be pushed.** A tall glass on a narrow foot tips before it
slides. That has to be a refusal, not an attempt.

**μ is not known.** It is a property of the glass, the table and whatever is on
both, and nothing in the cell measures it. So the arithmetic above gives a
limit that is only as good as a guessed number. That is an argument for always
pushing as low as the gripper can reach, and for watching what actually happens
rather than trusting the prediction.

## What else makes this hard

**Where to push it *to*.** The destination has to be clear of every other
glass, clear of the rack, inside the arm's reach, and inside the part of the
table the glasses are allowed to be on. Moving one glass out of a crowd can
easily push it into a different crowd.

**A push does not go where you aimed it.** Friction under a glass is not
uniform, the contact is not a point, and the glass rotates as well as slides.
Planar pushing is a well-studied problem and the honest summary is that
predicting the outcome precisely needs numbers nobody here has. So the arm has
to look again after each push rather than assume.

![A finger that meets a round glass anywhere but on the line through its middle turns the glass as well as moving it, so only a push aimed through the middle slides it roughly straight.](../../images/pushing-the-glasses-apart/what-is-asked-for/problem-3-an-off-centre-push-spins.png)

**Which glass to move.** Moving the wrong one of a pair can make the situation
worse — into a third glass, or out of reach. The choice needs the whole
arrangement, not just the crowded pair.

**Pushing is contact, and contact is where things break.** The arm is touching
a glass with no idea how heavy it is. Too fast is a knock, and a knock on a
tall glass is the thing this problem exists to avoid.

## What is deliberately not in this problem

**Lifting anything.** No grasp, no weighing, no rack.

**Measuring a profile.** Problem 3 works from a footprint and a position.

**Deciding the kind.** Still one known kind.

**Tidying.** The glasses do not have to end up anywhere in particular. They have
to end up far enough apart.

## What "done" means

A run is **done** when every glass on the table has at least 70 mm of clear
room around it, at least one usable viewpoint for a side-on photograph, and
nothing has been knocked over.

A run is **correct but incomplete** when a glass could not be moved safely and
is reported with the reason — most often that it tips before it slides, or that
there is nowhere clear to push it to.

A run is **wrong** if a glass is toppled, pushed out of reach, pushed off the
table, or pushed into the rack. Toppling is the failure to watch, because a
toppled glass cannot be recovered by anything else in this project.

Scored against the simulator's record, the numbers worth watching are: how many
glasses ended up grippable, how many pushes it took, how far each glass ended
up from where the push aimed it, and how many were refused.

## Where to go next

Three documents describe what every answer shares, and they are worth reading
before any of the six.

- [The test bench](../02_the-test-bench.md) — the crowded tables, what an answer is
  given, and how a run is marked.
- [The target layout](02_the-target-layout.md) — where the glasses should end up,
  which is computed rather than learned, and the least movement the task needs.
- [Pushing without toppling](03_pushing-without-toppling.md) — the height limit
  that decides whether a glass slides or tips, and the loop of plan, feel and
  look again.

Then the six answers themselves:
