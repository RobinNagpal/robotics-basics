"""The arm's numbers, checked against the rules that depend on them.

These tests exist because the two files can drift apart silently: a grip rule
that asks for more wall than the pads are tall, or a glass record that allows
an opening wider than the gripper, both fail at run time in a way that looks
like a planning problem.
