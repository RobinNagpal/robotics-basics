"""Solution 5, the lower rung: SAM 2 outlines everything, and a fitted keeper picks the glasses.

The borrowed half is `facebook/sam2.1-hiera-base-plus`, used exactly as it was
downloaded. It is prompted with a regular grid of points over the picture, it
answers every prompt with an outline, and nothing here ever computes a gradient
through it. The second generation is wanted for its stronger picture encoder;
the memory it carries between the frames of a video is not used, because this
problem is answered one picture at a time.
What comes back is a heap rather than a list of objects: the same region arrives
from dozens of prompts, and one prompt returns a part, a whole and something
larger. Scoring, stability and duplicate removal cut the heap down to a shortlist
of **proposals**, and none of that involves fitting either.

The upper rung of this solution is `sam3_words.py`, which asks a generation
newer for the word "drinking glass" and needs no grid and no keeper. Everything
after the model is shared with this file.

The fitted half is the **keeper**, which is the only thing in this solution that
knows anything about this cell. It is shown eight measurements of one proposal
and answers one of three things: this is one glass, this is not a glass, or this
is more than one glass. Boosted decision trees, because the input is a short
table of numbers of different kinds. Its probability is calibrated, and it has
two thresholds rather than one, so a proposal between them is reported as
doubtful instead of being quietly kept or quietly dropped.

The arithmetic keeps the last word. A proposal the keeper wants to keep is still
fitted with a circle by `masks_to_glasses`, and a width outside the range this
kind of glass can be is refused whatever the keeper said. A learned part chooses
among regions; a rule nobody trained decides whether the choice is believable.

**The kind of glass is handed in with the picture.** It is not derivable from a
picture and the problem statement says the cell is told it, so it arrives as an
argument rather than being read out of the scene behind the picture. What it
settles is the range of footprints a glass here could have and how fine the grid
of prompts has to be; no glass's size is written down anywhere for it.

**The camera belongs to data.py**, which stands it at the cell's own survey
height and takes the three pictures a survey there needs. Nothing in this file
chooses a viewpoint, so every solution scored on this bench is guaranteed the
same pictures.
