"""The action chunk: a recorded jaw path in, a chunk the bench can follow out.

A demonstration is the path the jaw really followed, which the bench writes
down on every action as ``Record.waypoints``. A chunk is what the policy
emits. This module is the arithmetic between the two, and it holds no model
and no geometry of pushing.

Three decisions live here, and each one is a choice the document leaves open.

**The chunk is the push and nothing else.** A recorded path runs descend,
feel, push, back off, lift. ``Bench.follow`` already does the descent for
free --- it puts the jaw clear above the first waypoint and brings it down,
stopping if it touches something --- and lifts at the end. So the part worth
copying is the part at push height from where the jaw starts moving across
the table to the furthest point it reached. The back-off and the lift are
trimmed off; the bench does both.

**A chunk is a fixed number of waypoints.** The policy's output has a fixed
shape, so every demonstration is resampled to ``CHUNK`` points. Waypoints are
consumed one ``WAYPOINT_PERIOD`` apart, so the resampling is in time rather
than in distance: the shape of the demonstrated speed --- slow while feeling
for the glass, quicker once pushing --- is kept, and only the overall tempo
is stretched or squeezed. ``CHUNK`` is set near the median length of the
teacher's own pushes, so a typical demonstration replays close to the speed
it was made at. A long one runs faster than it did and a short one slower.

How much faster is bounded, and not by anything here. The bench gives a leg
``max(WAYPOINT_PERIOD, length / TOP_SPEED)`` seconds, so waypoints further
apart than ``TOP_SPEED * WAYPOINT_PERIOD`` --- 10 mm --- are simply taken
slower rather than at a speed the arm does not have. The teacher's own legs
are under 2 mm, and resampling the longest of its pushes into ``CHUNK``
points leaves them under 2 mm as well, so the cap does not bind on anything
copied from it. It would bind on a policy that learned to emit coarser
waypoints than its demonstrations, and the effect would be a slower push
rather than a faster one.

**Heading is carried as its cosine and sine.** An angle wraps at pi, and a
model fitted to a wrapping number learns the wrap as a cliff. Two numbers
that do not wrap cost one column and remove the problem. ``to_waypoints``
turns them back into an angle.
