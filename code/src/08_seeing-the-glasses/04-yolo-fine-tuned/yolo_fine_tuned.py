"""Solution 4: the borrowed YOLO26-seg model, with its training continued here.

The same library, the same model and the same downloaded file as solution 3.
One thing differs, which is that the weights this module loads have had their
training continued on this cell's own pictures, and the borrowed list of
everyday categories has been replaced by the single class "glass". That change
comes with the training rather than beside it, because a model cannot be
trained towards this cell's labels while still being asked which everyday
object it is looking at. So nothing varies between the pair that the training
did not bring, and the gap between the two scorecards is a measurement of what
fine-tuning bought.

**What one class removes.** Two of solution 3's failures go with the borrowed
category list. A glass can no longer come back twice under two neighbouring
everyday categories, because there is one name, so the two candidates covering
one glass are candidates of the same class and the model's own suppression step
reduces them to one answer before anything leaves it. And a glass can no longer
be lost because the model named it a bowl or a vase and a filter on names threw
it away, because there is no filter on names. This file therefore has no list of
acceptable categories anywhere in it, and that absence is the solution.

**What one class does not give** is the kind of glass. The model reports no kind
at all. Nothing asks it to: every glass in one arrangement is the same kind and
the cell is told which.

**What training does not fix.** The outline is still built coarsely — a short
weighted sum of pattern images, cut at a threshold and then enlarged — so a
thin stem is still the first thing lost and the mask's edge is still
approximate, which the shared arithmetic feels when it reads a width off that
edge. Fine-tuning closes the domain gap; it does not make the outline fine. The
masks are also still the pixels the camera saw, so a glass standing partly
behind another is still read as a smaller glass in the wrong place, and a glass
nothing saw at all leaves no candidate and no entry.

**The one refusal, and the one thing that excuses it.** A candidate whose
footprint no glass of this kind could have is reported as a doubt rather than
kept, which is the prescribed check and can only turn a glass into a doubt. It
is **not** applied to a candidate whose mask reaches the edge of the picture. At
the cell's own survey height one picture does not hold the glass zone, so a
glass near the frame edge shows part of its footprint and the width read off it
is not the glass's width. Two measurements say so. The bench's own exact masks,
one station at a time over 20 held-out spawned scenes, give a footprint outside
the kind's range for 66 of 297 glass sightings, and every one of those 66
reaches the frame edge; and of this model's own refusals over eight of those
scenes, all eleven too-narrow ones had a mask touching that edge. So the check
was refusing the view rather than the mask, and the fact it now reads first is
`masks_to_glasses.Found.cut_off`. The survey's three overlapping stations are
what make this safe rather than generous: where a glass was seen squarely by
another station, that station's report is the one `marking.survey` keeps.

**The camera belongs to data.py**, which stands it at the cell's own survey
height and takes the pictures a survey there needs. Nothing here chooses a
viewpoint, so this solution and its partner are guaranteed the same pictures.
