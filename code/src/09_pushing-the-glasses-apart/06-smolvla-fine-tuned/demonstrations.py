"""Run the teacher, watch what the jaw did, and write it down as a LeRobot dataset.

The teacher is [solution 2](../02-geometry-ranked), run unchanged over the
training tables. Every push it makes is a finished example, and nobody holds a
controller: the tables are drawn from numbers and the chooser is a program, so
the data costs simulator time and nothing else.

**A demonstration is a picture and a path.** The picture is what the model
would have been shown at that moment — the straight-down view, taken just
before the jaw moves — together with where the jaw was standing and the one
instruction. The path is what the jaw really did, which the bench writes into
``Record.waypoints`` on every action, cut and resampled by ``chunks.py``.
Nothing here invents a trajectory; the teacher thinks in push parameters and
the bench's own macro turns them into the motion that is recorded.

**The pushes that went wrong are dropped**, which is the right thing to do and
has a cost the document is explicit about: what is dropped is exactly the set
of situations the teacher handled badly, so the policy is fitted on the easy
half of its teacher's own experience. The counts below say how much was
dropped and why, so the size of that bias is on the record rather than
guessed at.

The 5 mm test pushes are dropped too, and for a different reason. A probe
belongs to the shared tipping check in [pushing without
toppling](../../docs/03-push-glasses-apart/pushing-without-toppling.md), not
to the chooser, and both halves of the pair make it the same way through
``push()``. It is not a push at the task and it is not this model's to learn.
