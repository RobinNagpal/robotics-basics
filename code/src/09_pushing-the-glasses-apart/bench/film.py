"""Film a table being cleared, to check by eye what the jaw did.

A Bench that also records a video. It changes nothing about the physics: it
only looks at the world after each step. Written the way
v5-learn-pick-place/pick_place/video.py films an episode, with MuJoCo's
offscreen renderer, so it needs no window and no mjpython.

Used by both approaches' run.py, with ``--film N`` to film the first N tables.

A take is shown, not just done. The bench racks a glass by moving it off the
table in one instant, which on film looks like the glass vanishing. So before
each take the film shows the jaw coming to the glass, lifting it and carrying
it off towards the rack. That is drawn on a copy of the world and never
stepped, so the physics, and every result, are the same filmed or not.
