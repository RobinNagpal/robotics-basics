"""Pictures for solution 9 — a fine-tuned instance segmenter.

Seven figures, each carrying one point of the document:

    09-class-map-against-instances.png  one label per pixel against one mask per glass
    09-the-two-stages.png               propose regions, then classify and cut a mask
    09-what-a-backbone-brings.png       what arrives already fitted, and why it transfers
    09-fine-tune-against-scratch.png    how many labelled scenes each start needs
    09-boxes-scores-masks.png           what one pass returns, and what the score is for
    09-overlapping-proposals.png        many boxes for one glass, collapsed by overlap
    09-where-it-stops.png               a glass with no pixels is in no output

Run from inside code/:

    pixi run python ../docs/diagrams/robotics-by-example/make_09_images.py

Every scene here is a legal arrangement of the shared cast of glasses: a couple
of large ones and a couple of the smallest this kind allows, with every pair of
centres at least the guaranteed gap apart. The arrangement is checked in code
rather than trusted, and every silhouette is a real splayed projection through
this cell's overhead camera, from ``diagram_style.splay_circles``, so the
overlaps and the one complete cover are geometry rather than drawing.

Every number that appears as a label is arithmetic on those silhouettes, on the
camera's own numbers, or on the constants at the top of this file. The two
training curves are the exception that says so on its own face: they are the
shape of a claim, not a measurement of a trained network.
