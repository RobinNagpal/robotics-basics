"""Diagrams for solution 10 — learn a forward model, then plan against it.

Five pictures, and every number printed as it is drawn so that the document can
quote it rather than guess it.

Three rules were kept while writing this.

**Every glass is a real glass.** Its rim, its foot and its height come from
``work_cell.glasses.shapes``, drawn inside ``KIND_RANGES["tapered_glass"]`` by
the project's own ``family`` and ``random_glasses``. No size is typed in.

**Every arrangement is a real layout**, in the sense that the positions come
from ``random_glasses``, which places glasses one at a time wherever the ones
already down leave room. It has to be crowded afterwards, and that is the
awkward part worth stating in the open: ``spawn.MIN_SEPARATION`` is 150 mm and
no pair is ever closer, while a glass loses its room somewhere below 123 mm, so
**the shipped spawner cannot produce a crowded table at all.** The crowding
here is made by sliding a glass in along the line towards a neighbour until the
pair sits between having the room the jaw needs and touching, which is what
``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/bench/bench.py`` does to its own tables. Every picture that uses a
crowded table says so.

The authoritative crowded-table generator is ``bench.scene``, not this file.
It is not imported here because it imports MuJoCo, which this project's root
environment does not carry, and every generator in this repository has to run
from the root. What ``bench`` was measured for instead is written down as the
``BENCH_*`` constants below, with the script that produced them named.

**Whether a glass has room is the asymmetric test**, ``diagram_style.has_room``:
a neighbour's *edge* has to be outside 70 mm of this glass's middle, so what
decides is how wide the neighbour is. The round 140 mm in ``problem.md`` is the
worst case of that, for two of the widest glasses the kind allows.

**Nothing here is a trained model's output.** There is no model in this file.
Where a picture needs a prediction, the prediction is a stand-in stated in the
caption: the glass slides the full length of the push along the push, and the
error between prediction and outcome is the 4.5 mm median that
``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/04-a-world-model``'s README records for its own model on unseen tables.
