"""Diagrams for solution 2 — one fixed nudge.

Every glass drawn here is a real glass, and every arrangement is a real table.
The outlines come from ``work_cell.glasses.shapes`` at sizes drawn from
``KIND_RANGES["tapered_glass"]``, and the places they stand in come from the
layout rule in ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/bench/bench.py``, which is the generator the real runs
are scored against. No glass's size is written down in this file.

**Why the layout rule is copied rather than imported.** ``bench.py`` imports
MuJoCo, which is installed in ``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/01-one-fixed-nudge`` and
``code/src/09_pushing-the-glasses-apart/04-a-world-model`` but not in the root environment every generator in this
repository runs from. ``scene`` and ``_crowded_layout`` need none of it, so
they are mirrored below, in metres, exactly as they are written there. The copy
was checked against the original over 2399 seeds — every tapered test seed this
script uses, and 399 more covering all four kinds — and it produced the same
glasses in the same places every time.

**Why not ``spawn.random_glasses``.** Problem 2's spawner keeps
``MIN_SEPARATION`` = 150 mm between centres, which is above every crowding
threshold in problem 3, so no table it draws has a glass without room and the
problem never starts. ``bench.scene`` stands 60 per cent of its glasses
deliberately close to one already down, which is what makes a crowded table.

**Which test decides crowding.** ``has_room`` from ``diagram_style``, which is
``bench.py``'s own and is not symmetric: a glass has room when every other
glass's *edge* is at least 70 mm from its middle, so what a glass needs depends
on how wide its neighbour is. ``GRIPPABLE_APART`` (140 mm) is the conservative
symmetric bound, and is used here only to price the rule the overview wrote
down in those terms.

Every number this script prints is a number the document quotes.
