"""Clear one table, and write down everything the arm saw, asked and did.

For reading, not for scoring. It runs the same plan.clear as run.py on the
same table, so the pushes are the ones in results.json, and beside each it
writes what went into the model, what came out, and what then really happened.

    pixi run python trace_table.py                 # table 10000, the first held-out one
    pixi run python trace_table.py --table 10003

Writes traces/table-<seed>/trace.json, video.mp4 and a picture for each step,
named by the step's number. A push gets three: what the model expects, the jaw
at the end of the push, and what the next look found. Lengths in the file are
millimetres and angles are degrees, except the ``row`` lists, which are the
numbers exactly as the model takes them and gives them.
