"""The arm, its gripper, and the two sensors that matter when handling glass.

Planning goes through MoveIt: free moves are planned by OMPL and can bend
around the table, the rack and the other glasses, while approach, retreat and
the descent into a slot use MoveIt's Cartesian path service so the gripper
travels in a straight line rather than arriving from wherever the planner
fancied.

Three capabilities here exist only because the thing being carried is glass.

**Squeezing to a force.** Opening the fingers is a position job, but holding a
glass is not: what matters then is how hard the pads press. The gripper
therefore has two controllers and this class swaps between them.

**Weighing what is held.** The wrist force sensor is the only way to find out
what a glass actually weighs, and a glass's weight is not knowable in advance
because its wall thickness is not visible from outside.

**Turning in place.** Inverting a glass is a rotation about an axis through the
grip, not a move to a new pose. Asking for it as a pose would let the planner
take the glass on a detour to get there.
