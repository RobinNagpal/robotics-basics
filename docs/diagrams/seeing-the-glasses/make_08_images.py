"""Diagrams for solution 5 — SAM 2 with a keeper.

Twelve pictures, each carrying one point of the document:

    08-a-fixed-list-of-classes.png   a model whose question was settled when
                                     its weights were fitted
    08-what-promptable-means.png     the same picture prompted at two points,
                                     giving two masks from unchanged weights
    08-the-prompt-grid.png           a regular grid of prompt points over the
                                     top view, and what each point returns
    08-everything-is-proposed.png    the pile that comes back: glasses, table,
                                     a rim on its own, two glasses as one
    08-keeper-three-answers.png      the pile in, and one of three answers out
                                     for each proposal
    08-keeper-one-tree.png           one shallow tree: threshold questions down
                                     to a leaf, and the leaf is a small push
    08-keeper-boosting.png           the trees added up, one set per answer
    08-keeper-two-thresholds.png     the doubtful band between the two
                                     thresholds on the calibrated probability
    08-the-domain-gap.png            photographs against a grey picture shaded
                                     from depth, which is the honest risk
    08-borrowed-against-trained.png  what SAM 2 brings against what is fitted here,
                                     and against solution 2, which fits it all
    08-where-it-stops.png            a glass covered completely by another, so
                                     no prompt point can land on it
    08-why-nothing-catches-it.png    the chain from that geometry to the keeper
                                     never being shown the glass at all

Run from the project root:

    pixi run python ../docs/diagrams/seeing-the-glasses/make_08_images.py

Every number that appears as a label is computed from the constants at the top
of this file, so none of it can drift. The scenes are built from the shared cast
in ``diagram_style``, and their silhouettes come from ``splay_circles``, so the
geometry is the cell's own: which glass covers which is decided by
``splay_covers`` and checked before anything is drawn, and every arrangement is
asserted to be a legal one, with centres at least the guaranteed gap apart.

The two weight counts in the borrowed-against-fitted picture are arithmetic on
the published widths and depths of the models, not measurements of a file on
disk. They are the right size and within a few percent of it. The keeper's own
size is counted in its own terms, because it is boosted decision trees and a
tree has no weights: what is fitted there is a threshold per split and a value
per leaf.
