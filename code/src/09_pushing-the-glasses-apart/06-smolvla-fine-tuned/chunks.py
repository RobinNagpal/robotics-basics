"""Turning a push the jaw really made into the chunk the model is trained to emit.

The bench writes down the path the jaw followed on every action, including a
parameterised ``push()``. That recording is the demonstration. It is not yet a
training target, though, and three things have to happen to it first. All
three are arithmetic on the recording; none of them invents a path.

**Cut off the ends the model does not produce.** A recorded push is the jaw
coming down from travel height, feeling forward, pushing, backing off and
lifting clear. ``follow()`` does the coming down and the backing off itself —
it places the jaw above the first waypoint and lifts it after the last — so
what is left for the model is the part in between: the jaw at push height,
travelling forward, up to the far end of the push.

**Resample it to the length of a chunk.** SmolVLA emits a fixed number of
actions in one pass, and that number is a property of the borrowed model, not
a choice made here. A recorded push is longer than that, so the cut path is
resampled to exactly ``CHUNK`` points, evenly along its own length.

That resampling has one consequence worth stating plainly, because it is a
real difference between the student and its teacher. The bench consumes
waypoints a fixed period apart, so **how far apart they are is how fast the
jaw goes**, up to ``TOP_SPEED``, past which the leg simply takes longer.
Squeezing a push into a chunk's worth of waypoints therefore makes the
student's push faster than the teacher's. Over the demonstrations a chunk
covers about 90 mm in 49 waypoint periods, which is about 36 mm/s against the
teacher's 10 mm/s of feeling and 20 mm/s of pushing, and well under the
200 mm/s the jaw tops out at, so the cap never binds on a demonstration.
Nothing can be done about it without either changing the chunk length, which
is the borrowed model's, or asking the model several times per push, which
would spend several pushes of the shared budget on one.

**Read it in the convention both halves of the pair use.** Each waypoint goes
through ``joining.to_state``, which is the same reading, backwards, that
``joining.to_jaw`` applies to what the model emits. So the targets the model
is trained towards are in the units it answers in, and a chunk that came back
unchanged would decode to the push that was recorded.
