"""SmolVLA with a small low-rank correction learned on this bench's pushes.

The model is the one [solution 5](../05-smolvla-as-it-downloads) downloads,
and it is loaded the same way: the same weights, the same configuration, the
same pre- and post-processing, the same picture and the same sentence. This
module adds one thing and removes nothing. ``Fitted`` is solution 5's
``Downloaded`` with the correction loaded on top of it, so the asking is
inherited rather than written again — the pair is only clean while everything
but the training is the same code.

**What the correction is.** Every weight table the training touches keeps its
borrowed numbers, and a correction is added beside it. The correction is
forced through a narrow squeeze: a thin table down to ``RANK`` numbers and a
thin table back out to full width. That is LoRA, and the two thin tables
together hold about one per cent of the model, which is what makes the
training fit in the memory this machine has.

**Where it is put.** On the query, key, value and output projections of every
attention layer, in the vision-language half and in the action expert alike.
Those are the tables a change in what the model attends to has to go through,
and they are the standard place to put an adapter. The feed-forward tables
are left alone, which is the ordinary trade: fewer numbers to fit, less of
the model that can move.

**What happens to it afterwards.** Once trained, the two thin tables are
multiplied out and added into the borrowed table, and what is left is a model
of exactly the original size, running at exactly the original speed. So the
compute column on the scorecard is solution 5's, and nothing separating the
two scores can be put down to one of them being given more computation.

Loading downloads about 2 GB the first time and then reads the cache.
Nothing in the tests comes through here, because a test that needs a download
is not a test.
