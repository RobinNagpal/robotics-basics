"""Run one solution over the held-out scenes, score it, and write its numbers.

    pixi run python run.py --solution sam --scenes 20
    pixi run python run.py --solution amodal --crowded --show

The same three names as train.py and the same table, and the same indifference
to which of them was asked for: what `make train` wrote is loaded, the solution
is handed one picture at a time, and what it hands back is scored.

**A survey is three pictures, not one.** At the cell's own survey height one
picture does not hold the glass zone, because a rim seen from above leans away
from the point below the camera, so the cell stands at three stations and this
file asks the solution about each picture on its own. The three answers are then
brought together and a glass is counted once. Which of a place's reports is kept
is decided by how far the glass stood from the point below that station's camera:
nearest first, because a glass directly under the camera has no splay and cannot
be cut off at the frame edge, so that station's report is the one to believe.
That is the whole reason the cell surveys from overlapping stations.

What a solution hands back is masks_to_glasses.Found, which is the one shape
every solution in this folder produces: the pixels of one glass, the place on the
table they give, and the width. That place and that width come from
masks_to_glasses for all three, so a difference in the scorecard belongs to how
the mask was drawn and never to what was done with the mask afterwards.

A solution is handed the picture and the kind of glass on the table, which the
cell is told, and never the scene behind it: no list of glasses and no true mask,
which is what data.py keeps for training.

What comes out is `results-<solution>.json` and the same find line
../problem-2-programmed and ../problem-2-learned print, so the three approaches
can be set beside each other.
