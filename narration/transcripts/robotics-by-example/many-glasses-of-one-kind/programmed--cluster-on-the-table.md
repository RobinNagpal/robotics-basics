Solution two, cluster on the table. 

This approach is programmed. It means we stop deciding which pixels belong together by looking at the picture, and instead decide it by looking at where they are in the room.

The physical setup is described just once, on the page about the cell. That earlier page covers the layout, the two places the camera works from, which are from the top and from the side, all four sensors, and the words this project uses for them. Because of that, what follows here is only what is specific to this second solution.

<!-- section: introduction | Introduction -->

This page is titled Solution 2, cluster on the table. The introduction explains the method this project actually relies on to tell several glasses apart. The problem it solves is that a photograph can join two glasses into one shape even when they stand well apart on the table, so any decision made inside the picture starts from information that has already been lost. The idea here is to stop deciding in the picture altogether, and to decide on the table instead. By the end you will understand how a pixel with a distance reading becomes a point in the room, why throwing away the height of those points makes the problem easy rather than harder, how points are grouped by nothing more than how close together they are, and why fitting a circle to each group is what keeps the whole method honest.

There is a second half to this document, and it exists because of one property of the glasses in this problem. Because a single kind spans a small tapered glass at one end and a large one at the other, a tall glass can cover a short one completely when seen from above, and a glass that produced no pixels cannot be found by any method that looks at pixels. So a later part of the page, about when the glasses are completely hidden, is about a different question. It asks not what was seen, but what could not have been.

<!-- section: the-problem-this-solves | The problem this solves -->

This section describes the problem the solution is meant to solve. To do that, we need to be clear about the situation and about two words.

The situation is this. Four to six drinking glasses stand on a table. They are all of the same kind, and we know which kind. They are solid and they stand upright. They stand inside a rectangle of table that is a little wider than it is deep, which this project calls the glass zone. The camera sits on the arm's wrist, and in this solution it works from the top, which means that the arm lifts it high above the table, well clear of the tallest glass, and points it straight down. The job is to say which pixels belong to which glass, where each glass stands, and roughly how wide it is, and to say honestly which glasses could not be told apart.

The phrase "stand well apart" has a definite meaning here, and the whole method depends on it. This problem promises a smallest gap between the centres of any two glasses, and that gap is wider than any glass of any kind the cell handles. Because of that promise, two glasses can never be touching, and there is always a strip of bare table between them. Everything below rests on that strip existing.

The first word we need is mask. A mask is a picture the same size as the camera's picture, in which every pixel holds only yes or no, where yes means that the robot believes this pixel shows something standing on the table.

The second word is flood fill, which is the method the project already uses for a single glass. A flood fill picks a yes pixel that nobody has visited yet, spreads out to every neighbouring pixel that is also yes, and calls everything it reached one object. With one glass on an empty table that is enough, because whatever is joined together is the glass. With five glasses it is not enough.

An illustration shows how this fails. On the left of the picture, two outlines touch each other, so the flood fill hands back one merged patch. On the right, the same two glasses are drawn where they really stand, with a clear strip of bare table between them. The camera did not move them closer together. What it did was throw away the one piece of information that would have kept them apart, which is which pixels were near the camera and which were far.

The reason a photograph from above joins them, and can even lose them, is worth understanding properly. It is the reason the fix has to work outside the picture, and the same mechanism causes a second, worse failure.

A photograph of a tall object is not a photograph of its base. The camera is looking from the top, so the table is the furthest thing from the lens, and a glass's rim is the nearest thing, because the rim has climbed most of the way from the table up towards the camera. Nearer things look larger, and they also land further out from the middle of the picture. So the rim of a glass is drawn as though the glass stood further out from the point directly below the camera than it really does, and the taller the glass, the further out it is thrown. This project calls that effect splay, and it is explained in full on the page about the cell.

The practical result is that a tall glass's outline leans outwards, away from the point below the camera, and it can come to rest on top of whatever is standing in that direction.

Whether that matters depends entirely on how much the heights inside the kind differ, and in this problem they differ a great deal. The tall end of the tapered kind is more than twice the height of the short end. A tall glass is therefore thrown outwards a long way while a short glass standing beyond it is barely thrown at all, so the tall glass's outline can reach the short one and pass right over it.

That gives two failures rather than one, and they are not equally dangerous.

The first failure is the merge, which is the loud one. If the tall glass's outline reaches the short one without covering it, the two touch and come back as a single patch. That patch is wider than any glass of this kind can be, so something downstream can notice.

The second failure is the complete cover, which is the quiet one. If the tall glass's outline covers the short one entirely, the short glass contributes no pixels at all. What comes back is one patch, of one perfectly legal width, with a clean outline. Nothing about it is wrong. The picture simply holds one glass fewer than the table does.

This second failure cannot be answered by grouping pixels better, because the pixels are not there to group. It is answered instead by a piece of arithmetic that never looks at the picture's contents at all. This arithmetic is set out later on this page, in the part about when the glasses are completely hidden.

So the fix is not a better flood fill, however carefully it is written. The fix is to stop grouping in the picture.

<!-- section: the-main-idea | The main idea -->

This section explains the main idea, which is a change of place rather than a change of algorithm.

A depth camera gives a distance for every pixel, and that is enough to turn each pixel into a point in the room. The pixel tells you which direction the camera was looking, the depth tells you how far along that direction to travel, and the camera's own pose tells you where that direction starts. Once every pixel has become a point in the room, the question of which glass is which is no longer a question about the picture. It becomes a question about distance on the table.

That change matters because the strip of bare table between two glasses, which the photograph could not show us, is simply there once the points are in the room. Two glasses that touch each other in a photograph are still standing well apart on the table, and on the table is where we do the deciding.

A diagram illustrates this whole method in four pictures, showing the steps in order. First is the depth picture. Second is the points that stand above the table. Third, those points are flattened onto the table and grouped by how close together they are. Finally, one circle is fitted to each group. The sections below take one concept at a time, in that order.

<!-- section: turning-a-pixel-into-a-point-in-the-room | Turning a pixel into a point in the room -->

The next part of the page explains turning a pixel into a point in the room. 

The first concept is the one everything else is built on, and it has a name, which is back-projection. Projection is what a camera does when it turns a place in the room into a place in a picture. Back-projection is that step run in reverse.

The diagram illustrates this by showing how one pixel becomes a direction, and then a point. On the left is what the camera actually hands over, which is a grid of numbers. On the right is what one of those numbers means in the room. If you follow the line in the image, it starts at the camera, passes through a highlighted pixel, and stops where the depth reading says a surface is. The lesson is that a pixel on its own is not a thing. A pixel is a direction with a distance written on it.

Turning that into a point needs three inputs and no guessing. First, the pixel's column and row, measured out from the middle of the picture, give the direction. Second, the depth reading gives how far along that direction to travel. Third, the camera's pose says where the ray begins and which way it is facing. Scaling the sideways offsets by the depth, and then moving the result into the frame the arm works in, gives one point in the room.

Two details about the depth reading are worth knowing, because both catch people out. 

The first is that the depth is measured straight out along the lens axis, and not along the slanted line from the lens to that particular pixel. So, a pixel near the corner of the picture is genuinely further from the lens than its depth reading says. This is exactly why the sideways offsets are needed and why you cannot simply treat the depth as the distance. 

The second detail is that some pixels come back with no reading at all. Those are dropped rather than guessed, because a pixel with no distance cannot be placed anywhere in the room.

There is one more thing the camera hands over that is easy to misread, which is the focal length. Despite its name, the focal length used here is not a length in millimetres. It is a conversion factor between directions and pixels, and it follows from how wide an angle the lens covers and how many pixels it spreads that angle across. A wider lens over the same number of pixels gives a smaller focal length. The only thing this document needs from it is a consequence. Because the lens spreads a fixed angle over a fixed number of pixels, how much of the world one pixel covers depends only on how far away that world is.

That consequence explains the choice of camera height. From high above the table, one pixel covers a millimetre or two of table top. That is coarse compared with a ruler, but it is fine compared with a glass, which is tens of pixels across. The ratio between those two is why the method works at all.

Doing this for every pixel the mask kept gives a point cloud, which is simply a list of positions in the room. It has no grid, no neighbours and no order. That loss of structure sounds like a step backwards, and it is in fact the point. Neighbouring in the picture was the misleading idea we are trying to escape.

<!-- section: flattening-why-the-height-is-thrown-away | Flattening: why the height is thrown away -->

The next part of the page explains flattening, and why the height is thrown away. 

This second concept is the one that often surprises people, because it throws information away on purpose. Every point is dropped straight down onto the table, so a point in three dimensions becomes a flat dot in two.

To see why that helps, the diagram shows what the cloud of points actually looks like. On the left of the picture are two glasses as points in full three dimensions. Notice that there are plenty of points on the tops of the glasses, a few near their bases, and almost nothing in the shaded band in between. The reason for this is that a camera looking down from the top sees the side wall of a glass edge-on, and an edge-on wall catches almost no pixels. Because of this, the cloud is not shaped like a glass at all. It is more like a lid with a ring of crumbs underneath it.

That shape is fatal if you try to group the points in three dimensions. The argument is worth following slowly, because it is the heart of this step. 

In three dimensions, the top of a glass and the base of that same glass are separated by the glass's whole height, with a hole in between where the wall should have been. Meanwhile, the nearest points of two different glasses are separated only by the strip of bare table between them, and that strip is narrower than a glass is tall. So the gap inside one object is larger than the gap between two objects.

Once that is true, no grouping distance can possibly work. Any distance small enough to keep the two glasses apart also cuts each glass into a top and a bottom. Any distance large enough to hold one glass together also reaches across to its neighbour. There is no value in between to choose, because the two requirements have crossed over.

Flattening removes the problem completely. Each glass becomes a small solid disc, no taller than the paper it is drawn on, while the strip of bare table between two discs is exactly as wide as it was, because flattening moves nothing sideways. Now the gap inside one object is zero and the gap between two objects is the whole strip, so there is a wide range of grouping distances that work.

The short way to remember this is that height is the dimension that varies most and tells you least.

One caveat belongs here, so that nobody reads more into the disc than it holds. The flattened disc is not the base of the glass. It is the outline of the glass's widest horizontal slice, because that slice is what hides everything underneath it from a camera looking down. For a tumbler, the rim and the base are nearly the same width and the difference does not matter. For a wine glass, whose bowl is wider than its foot, the disc is the bowl. This problem asks only for a rough width, and the widest slice is the honest answer to that question. The exact shape is measured later, with the camera brought down and round to look at the glass from the side.

<!-- section: grouping-the-dots-by-how-close-they-are | Grouping the dots by how close they are -->

The next part of the page explains grouping the dots by how close they are. 

The third concept is the grouping rule itself, and it fits in one sentence. You start from a dot nobody has visited, and take every dot within a chosen distance of it. Then you take every dot within that distance of those. You keep going until nothing new is added, and call that clump one glass. Then you start again from a dot that has not been used.

This rule is called Euclidean cluster extraction, and its most important property is how little it is told. The only setting is the one distance. Nobody tells it how many groups to find, or how large they should be, or what shape they should have. That matters a great deal here, because a method that is told to find five groups cannot ever report that there were four or six, and reporting that honestly is the whole point of this problem.

The rule also chains, which means that if dot A joins dot B, and dot B joins dot C, then all three are one group, even if A and C are right across the table from each other. Chaining is what lets the rule hold a long, thin scatter of dots together without being told anything about shape. However, chaining is also the rule's one weakness, because a single stray dot sitting in the strip between two glasses is enough to link them into one group.

Because there is only one setting, it is worth being careful about how it is chosen, and the good news is that it is not chosen by trial and error. A diagram on the page illustrates this choice, showing how the grouping distance must fit between the small gaps separating dots on a single glass, and the larger gap of bare table separating two different glasses. The setting is pinned between these two limits that are both known before the run starts, and then placed in the gap between them. This is the same reasoning used when choosing a measurement tolerance, which must be larger than the instrument's noise and smaller than the smallest real difference that must not be missed.

The lower limit is set by how far apart the dots on one glass are. Neighbouring pixels land on neighbouring pieces of the table, so the dots arrive in a mesh whose spacing is roughly what one pixel covers. Two things change that spacing. First, the top of a glass is nearer the lens than the table is, which actually tightens the mesh there. Second, a surface seen at a slant, such as the shoulder of a glass or the outer curve of a bowl, spreads its dots out, because one pixel now covers a longer piece of surface. If the chosen distance is smaller than the widest stretch anywhere in that mesh, the chain breaks in the middle of a single glass, and one glass comes back as two or three groups.

The upper limit is set by the strip of bare table between two glasses, and there is a trap here that is worth naming. This problem promises a smallest gap between glass centres, but the grouping rule measures edge to edge. So the worst case is that smallest centre gap with the two widest glasses of the kind standing in it. Take half of each glass off the centre gap, and what is left is the narrowest strip the method will ever be shown. If the chosen distance is larger than that strip, the chain hops across it and two glasses come back as one.

How much room is there between those two limits? The worst case for the ceiling is the guaranteed centre gap with the two widest glasses of the kind standing in it, and that strip is comfortably wider than the widest stretch in the dot mesh. So there is a broad window, and almost any sensible value inside it works.

That is a reason to derive the value rather than to relax about it. The window is wide today because of two numbers that live in two different files, the widest rim this kind allows and the guaranteed gap between centres, and neither of them is this solution's to choose. So the grouping distance should be computed from those two and checked from the other side as well, against how far apart the measured dots actually fall, and the run should print both ends. A value that is derived stays correct when somebody widens a kind or moves the glasses closer together. A value that was typed in once goes quietly wrong on that day and takes a while to find.

Inside that window the value is placed deliberately low rather than in the middle, because the two mistakes are not equally bad. A glass split into two groups announces itself loudly, because both halves then fail the width check described next, since half a footprint is far too narrow to be a glass of this kind. Two glasses merged into one group are much quieter. So the setting leans towards splitting, which is the mistake that gets caught.

There is also a practical point about running the rule, and it is a useful habit rather than a detail of this problem. Comparing every dot with every other dot means a number of comparisons that grows with the square of the number of dots, which becomes hopeless quickly. Sorting the dots into square bins whose side is the grouping distance fixes it, because two dots within that distance of each other must lie either in the same bin or in one of the bins touching it, so each dot is only ever compared with a handful of others. The same idea under a grander name is a k-d tree.

<!-- section: fitting-a-circle-and-checking-it-against-the-kind | Fitting a circle, and checking it against the kind -->

The next part of the page explains how to fit a circle to these groups of dots, and how to check that circle against the kind of glass we expect. 

This is the fourth concept, and it is what keeps the method honest. It is the reason this solution can be trusted around a moving robot arm. Because a glass seen from above is a circle, each group of dots should form a filled disc. When you fit a circle to that disc, you get back a centre and a width. You also get a third number that turns out to be very useful, called the residual. This is simply how far the dots sit from the fitted circle on average.

The math for this fit has a pleasant property worth knowing. If you write the equation of a circle in the obvious way, it is not linear in its centre and its radius. Normally, that would mean you have to use an iterative search with a starting guess. However, if you multiply that equation out and treat certain combinations of the unknowns as the unknowns instead, the equation becomes linear. That means the fit has a direct solution. There is no iteration, no starting guess, and the radius is simply recovered at the end.

Using a fit is better than using the bounding box from the earlier code, and the reason is about noise rather than elegance. A bounding box is decided by exactly two dots, which are the two extreme ones. Those are precisely the two dots most likely to be noise. A fit, on the other hand, uses every dot, so the many ordinary dots outvote the few odd ones.

The diagram here illustrates how this circle fit acts as a safety net. On the left, it shows one circle fitted to a merged group of dots. This circle comes out several times wider than any glass of this kind can be, so it is rejected straight away. In the middle, the system tries fitting two circles instead, and both land inside the acceptable range. On the right is the ruler they are measured against, which represents the strict range of widths this specific kind of glass is allowed to have, and nothing else.

That ruler deserves attention because it is stronger here than it looks. Across all four kinds of glasses the cell handles, the range of possible widths is broad, since a narrow flute and a wide tumbler are very different objects. But within a single kind, the range is much narrower. Because this problem tells us exactly which kind of glass is on the table, the check available here is far tighter than a general-purpose test that only asks if the object is roughly the right size.

This check has four possible outcomes. First, if one circle fits and its width is inside the range, that is one glass and it is accepted. Second, if the width is outside the range, the group is not one glass of this kind, so two circles are tried instead. Third, if two circles both land inside the range and together account for all the dots, that is two glasses and both are reported. Finally, if the group still fails, it is reported as doubtful. The system provides the measured width and the range it failed, rather than just guessing.

Splitting a group in two is done using a simple and well-known method called k-means with two centres. You drop two seeds anywhere in the group, and give each dot to whichever seed is nearer. Then, you move each seed to the middle of the dots it was given, and repeat this process until nothing moves. After that, you fit a circle to each half.

What makes this check worth having is that it is arithmetic rather than judgement. The statement that a group is too wide to be one glass contains two numbers. Both of these numbers were known before the run started, and both of them can be printed in the report.

<!-- section: asking-the-stations-to-agree | Asking the stations to agree -->

The next part of the page covers asking the stations to agree. This is the fifth and last concept, and it is the cheapest of all, because the survey already does most of it.

The camera does not photograph the whole zone from one place. It visits several stations, spread out over the zone and overlapping each other so that nothing ends up only at the edge of one picture, where the view of it is worst. There is a subtlety in how many stations are needed, which is that the area a station can be trusted for is smaller than the area one picture covers. Two things shrink it. First, the camera slides a short way sideways between the station's two pictures, so only the part both pictures see counts. Second, the gripper's own fingers, opened wide, eat into the edges of the frame. Held against the shape of the glass zone, what remains works out to a single column of three stations, one behind the other, marching away from the arm.

The diagram illustrates two of these stations, and why they are asked to agree. It shows grey patches, which are the pieces of the table that each glass hides from that station. In the left panel, one glass sits well out towards the corner of the frame, so splay throws its top outwards past the edge of the picture and only the near part of its footprint comes back. In the right panel, that same glass is nearly straight below the camera, where splay throws it almost nowhere, so its footprint is complete. But now, a different glass is the awkward one.

That swap is the whole point of this step. Which glass is seen badly depends on where the camera is standing, so moving the camera changes which glass is the problem.

Three rules follow from it. First, a group found in about the same place from more than one station is a real glass. Second, its width is taken from the station that saw it nearest to straight down, because that is the station whose view of its footprint is least bitten into. Finally, a group found from one station only is reported as doubtful rather than as a glass, not because it is probably wrong, but because it has been seen once.

That third rule is the load-bearing part of the whole method, and the measurements in the part of the page about when the glasses are completely hidden are what make it so, though not for the reason a reader would guess. A glass is rarely lost from a station altogether. What happens instead is that nearly every glass is cut by the edge of the frame at one station or another, and most glasses have no station at all that returns a whole footprint. So a circle fitted at one station usually rests on an arc rather than on a complete disc, and an arc fits a circle that is too small and in the wrong place. 

Agreement between the stations is the cure for that, not for glasses vanishing. Each station cuts a given glass along a different line, so two stations that put the centre in the same place have fitted it to the glass rather than to the edge of a picture, and two that disagree have said so out loud. A group only one station found has nothing to check against, and it is precisely those glasses whose fitted circle is wrong in a way that looks plausible, so the flag that marks them is the difference between an honest answer and a confident one.

<!-- section: how-the-concepts-fit-together | How the concepts fit together -->

The next part of the page explains how the concepts fit together. Put in order, the concepts make one flow with two branches that run side by side, and the second branch is the one the wide size range added. The left branch places what was seen. The right branch works out what could not have been seen. They meet only at the report.

The diagram shows this flow starting with the mask, which identifies the pixels that stand above the table. These pixels are back-projected so each becomes a point in the room. Then, the height is dropped to flatten the data, turning each glass into a disc. The dots that are close together are grouped, and a circle is fitted to each group to find a centre, a width, and a residual. Next, it checks if the width is one that this kind of glass can be. If it is, it asks the stations to agree. If it is not, it tries fitting two circles instead. If both are now in range, it asks the stations to agree. If they are still not in range, it reports the group as doubtful and does not guess. When the stations agree, the result is one position and one rough width per glass.

Meanwhile, the right-hand branch calculates the blind spots. Notice that it takes its input from the fitted circles rather than from the pixels. It needs the positions, widths, and heights of the glasses that were found, and nothing else. From those glasses, it calculates the wedge hidden by each taller glass to find the total blind region for this camera position. Then it checks if any blind patch is big enough to hold the smallest glass. If no patch is big enough, it proceeds to the final report. But if there is a large enough patch, it reports it as an unsearched patch and asks the system to take another look. 

Because this second branch uses only the fitted circles, it can say something about glasses that produced no pixels at all by reasoning about what those glasses would have been behind. The part of the page below about when the glasses are completely hidden is where that branch is worked out.

In the diagram, green marks what this solution adds, such as the flattening, grouping, and blind spot checks. Blue marks work the project already does, like the initial mask, the back-projection, and asking the stations to agree.

There is one saving in that flow worth pointing out, because the textbook version of this recipe does more work. The standard recipe finds the table by searching for the largest flat surface in the point cloud. Here, the table's height is a constant the code can look up, because the table is bolted to the same frame as the arm. This turns finding the table into a simple comparison rather than a search. That is a real saving, but it is worth understanding rather than copying blindly. If the table were moved or the arm remounted, the constant would be wrong in a way that a search would not be.

<!-- section: what-comes-out-and-what-does-not | What comes out, and what does not -->

The next part of the page covers what comes out of the method, and what does not. 

For each glass, the method reports four things. First, it reports which pixels belong to the glass, carrying this information back from the group's dots to the original mask they came from. Second, it gives a position on the table, measured from the base of the arm. Third, it provides a rough width, which is the fitted diameter. Finally, it reports doubt, if there is any. This comes as one of several named flags, with each flag carrying the measurement that caused it to be raised.

There is also a fifth output, which does not belong to any specific glass. This is a list of unsearched patches. Each patch is a place on the table that no picture could have seen, but which is large enough to hold the smallest glass of this kind. The later part of the page about when glasses are completely hidden explains where this list comes from. 

This fifth output is worth insisting on because it is the only part of the report that talks about what is missing. The four per-glass outputs describe what was found. The list of unsearched patches is the difference between simply saying four glasses were found, and saying four glasses were found, and here is everywhere a fifth one could have been standing.

All of this information comes out in the same form that the existing survey already produces, so nothing downstream has to change. The positions drive the rest of the run, and the report prints the positions and widths. Any pair of glasses that could not be separated is handed over to the third problem, and the unsearched patches are sent to the solution that moves the camera.

It is worth being clear about the computational cost, because it is easy to worry about the wrong thing. The back-projection is arithmetic the project already does. The rest of the work is just a comparison, dropping one column of numbers, a flood fill over a grid of bins, and a direct least-squares solve. While it has not been timed on the current machine yet, the shape of the answer is clear. This is the kind of work a processor finishes while the arm is still deciding to move, and every small movement of the arm costs seconds. Therefore, computation is not the place to economize here. Any argument that this would be too slow to compute should be checked against the cost of moving the arm before it is believed.

The section then explains why there is no feedback loop. This is a deliberate limit, not an oversight. A feedback loop, in the way the other solutions use the term, needs three things: a measure of doubt, a set of actions that might reduce that doubt, and a budget so that the loop eventually stops. This method has the measure of doubt, but neither of the other two. It simply runs on whatever pictures the survey gave it and produces an answer. If a glass was seen badly, it stays seen badly.

What the method does produce is good doubt, in five named forms. Each of these is a concrete measurement rather than a feeling. First, a group's fitted width might be outside the expected range for that kind of glass. Second, a group's two-circle split might also have failed that range. Third, a group might have been found from only one viewing station. Fourth, a group might hold fewer dots than a glass of that size should produce, which usually means most of it was hidden. And fifth, there might be an unsearched patch large enough to hold the smallest glass of the kind. 

That fifth form is different from the other four in an important way. The first four are doubts about a thing that was actually found. The fifth is a doubt about a place. It is the only doubt that can trigger when the pictures contain nothing wrong at all, and it is the only one that could ever point at a glass nobody has seen yet.

All five of these doubts act as the input for the solution that moves the camera, which is covered on its own page. For the first four doubts, that solution's job is to take a doubtful group, work out where the camera would have to stand to get a clear view, check that the arm can reach that spot, go and look, and then run the grouping process again on the better picture. For the fifth doubt, the job changes shape. There is no group to stand around, only a region that the camera needs to get a view of.

The cost of having no feedback loop in this specific method is clear. If a pair of glasses merges together from every station the survey happens to visit, it is reported as one wide object with a flag saying its width is out of range, and nothing more. That is not a wrong answer, because it is flagged, but it is an incomplete one. Closing that gap is exactly what the arm has to move for.

<!-- section: when-the-glasses-are-completely-hidden | When the glasses are completely hidden -->

The next part of the page explains what happens when the glasses are completely hidden. 

Everything so far places the glasses the pictures contain. This part is about the glasses they do not, and it is the half of the method that the wide range of sizes inside this kind makes necessary.

The difficulty was named at the start of the document, and it is worth putting once more in the form the method has to deal with. A glass can contribute no pixels at all. It might not leave a partial arc, or even a few dots. When that happens, there is no group, no fitted circle, no residual, and no flag. Every check described earlier is a check on something that was found. None of them can fire for something that was not.

So the question has to be turned round. Instead of asking if a glass was missed, which nothing in the picture can answer, the system must ask where a glass could have been hiding.

That second question is one this solution can answer, and it can because of the same choice that makes the rest of it work. A method that decides in the picture has nothing left to work with once the pixels are gone. This one already holds the position, the width, and the height of every glass it did find, in millimetres on the table, and it holds the camera's own position in the same millimetres. From those it can work out which pieces of the table no ray from the lens ever reached, and it never has to look at the picture's contents again to do it. The union of those pieces is the blind region for that camera position.

A blind region always exists and most of it is harmless, so on its own it is a shape rather than an answer. The test that turns it into an answer uses the one thing this problem guarantees about sizes: the smallest glass of this kind has a known smallest footprint, which is 65 millimetres across. A blind patch matters only if it is large enough to hold that footprint. Anything narrower cannot be hiding a glass, whatever else it is hiding.

What comes out is therefore a short list of suspect patches. These are places on the table, each big enough to hold the smallest glass of this kind, that this camera position could not have seen. That is a finite list, it is computed from arithmetic alone, and it can be printed.

The arithmetic is not the same in the two places the camera works from, because a glass goes missing in two different ways there, and the two want different cures. First is the survey view, 450 millimetres above the table looking straight down, which is where this solution does its clustering. After that is the level view, 120 millimetres above the table and 380 millimetres back from the glass, which is where the arm goes to measure one glass and where it is sent back when a group is doubtful.

Start with the arithmetic for when the camera is looking straight down, because everything in this case follows from it.

Take a horizontal slice of a glass at some height, which is a circle. Seen from straight above, that circle is drawn as a circle again, but moved outwards from the point below the camera, and enlarged, both by the same factor. The factor is the camera's height divided by the distance from the camera down to the slice. With the camera at a height of H above the table and the slice at a height of z above the table, this is H divided by H minus z. It is never less than one. A slice lying on the table has a factor of exactly one and does not move at all. A slice 225 millimetres up, half way to a camera at the survey height of 450 millimetres, has a factor of exactly two. It is drawn twice as far out from the point below the camera as it really is, and twice as wide. So this effect, called splay, is a radial scaling about the point below the camera, and the higher the slice the harder it is thrown.

That is what lets one glass's outline reach over another. Take two glasses of this kind from the two ends of its range, 230 millimetres and 93 millimetres tall. Stand the tall one 200 millimetres out from the point below the camera, with the short one 150 millimetres beyond it on the same line, which is the closest together this problem ever puts two glasses. The tall glass's rim has a factor of 2.04 and is drawn 209 millimetres further out than it stands. The short glass's rim has a factor of 1.26 and is drawn 91 millimetres further out. The tall glass's outline therefore crosses the short one's and keeps going, and every point of the short glass's outline ends up inside it. The short glass contributes no pixels.

Hiding this way needs two things at once: the two glasses standing close together, and a large difference in their heights. The quickest way to see that is to break each of them in turn. Move the short glass another 50 millimetres out, so the pair is 200 millimetres apart rather than 150 millimetres, and it is visible again. Put it back and make it a second tall glass instead, so that the pair differ in position but no longer in height, and it is visible again. Swap the two over, so that the short glass is the nearer one, and it is visible again, because a short glass's outline is barely thrown at all and cannot reach over anything. So the hidden glass is always the shorter one, and it is hidden only when the two stand close together and differ a great deal in height.

There is a third condition, which is what the first diagram illustrates. Splay is radial, which means it acts along the line running out from the point below the camera and not across that line.

The diagram shows how the same pair of glasses hides along a radius but does not across one. On the left is the pair just described, lying along one radius, with the short glass's outline drawn as a dashed line completely inside the tall glass's. On the right are the same two glasses, still 150 millimetres apart and still of the same two sizes, but turned about the camera so that they lie across a radius instead, both the same distance out. Nothing about the pair has changed except the direction it lies in, and now the two outlines share no table at all. The picture holds two patches and both glasses are found. Whether a glass is hidden therefore depends on where the camera is standing, which is the same fact that asking the stations to agree rests on, arrived at from the other end.

It is worth being exact about what the run gets when the hiding does happen, because what comes back is not a damaged group. The pixels are the tall glass's outline, and every one of them carries a depth reading, so they back-project to the tall glass's own surface and flatten to its own footprint, 92 millimetres across. That is an ordinary width for a kind whose glasses run 65 to 105 millimetres. The circle fits it well, the residual is small, the group holds about as many dots as a glass that size should, and the next station finds a glass in the same place, because the tall glass really is there. Every check passes, and every one of them is right to pass. The glass that is missing was never what they were asked about.

One thing about the scaling factor cuts the work of the blind reasoning down, and it comes free with the mechanism. Because the factor grows with height, a taller glass is always thrown further out than a shorter one standing at the same distance. So for any glass, the only things that can be covering it are the glasses taller than it. Shorter neighbours cannot reach it, however close they stand. That gives a cheap ordering. The system sorts the glasses found by height, tallest first, and tests each one only against the ones above it in the list. It is the same trick as drawing a scene back to front, and it turns a test over every pair into a test over about half of them.

A second property of the scaling is what makes the blind region cheap to write down. Splay does not change a glass's angular width about the point below the camera at all. Scaling a circle's centre distance and its radius by the same factor leaves the ratio between them unchanged, and that ratio is what fixes the angle the circle subtends. So a glass covers the same wedge of directions whatever its height, and height only decides how far out along that wedge its outline is thrown.

That is why the hidden region can be computed in closed form rather than by drawing the scene and looking at it. The region a glass hides is a wedge, and the only question is where along that wedge it starts and stops. Each taller glass contributes one, clipped between the radius where its outline starts and the radius where it ends, and the edge of the frame contributes a ring outside everything. The union of all that is the blind region for that station. The important word is stops. No glass of this kind is thrown out by a factor of more than about two, so each wedge ends at a radius the arithmetic knows, and the blind region is a bounded shape with room inside it for a bounded number of glasses.

What all that is worth in this cell has a measured answer, and it is worth having, because this is an easy thing to oversell and the honest answer is more interesting.

Several hundred legal arrangements of four to six glasses of the widened kind were swept at the guaranteed gap. For every glass, the system asked what each of the survey's three stations returned of it: a whole footprint, part of one, or nothing at all. Three results came back.

First, a glass is lost from a station altogether only rarely. A small share of glasses produce no pixels at all at one of the three stations, and every one of those was covered by a taller neighbour rather than standing outside the frame. No glass was lost at two stations, let alone at all three, in any arrangement, even with several taller glasses contributing wedges at once. The reason is what the diagram showed earlier. The stations stand well apart, moving the camera moves the point below it, and every wedge swings when it does. So the union of the survey does find every glass, and the wide size range does not lose glasses outright in this cell. A count from one picture still cannot be trusted, because a glass does occasionally produce nothing at one station, but that rarity is not what makes a single station's answer thin. The next two results are.

Second, being seen in part is the ordinary case. Nearly every glass is cut by the edge of the picture at one station or another, and two things do it together. The stations are spread along the zone, so each one's frame is offset from the zone and part of the zone lies at or past that frame's edge. Also, splay throws the rim of a glass standing near that edge further out still, over it. What comes back from such a station is the near part of the footprint and nothing of the rest, which is a crescent rather than a disc.

Third, most glasses have no station at all that returns a whole footprint, and roughly one in six have exactly one. The overlap between the stations is meant to leave every glass well inside some picture, and for a minority of glasses it does. For the rest, every station cuts something off. This is the result worth carrying away, because it is the opposite of an unlucky case. Fitting a circle to an arc rather than to a whole footprint is what this method does most of the time, and an arc fits a circle that is too small and in the wrong place, with a plausible width and a small residual. Nothing in the arithmetic of one picture objects to any of that, which is why asking the stations to agree is a step and not a formality.

So the honest summary for this view is that the method handles the hidden case in part. It never finds the hidden glass, because there is nothing of it to find, but it says exactly where one could have been standing, and the spread of the stations then finds it. The blind-region arithmetic is not what finds the glasses in this cell; the spread of the stations already does that. What it does is let the run prove that its answer is complete, instead of hoping so. And it is what would catch the problem the day somebody moves the stations, drops one of them, widens the zone, or puts a glass on a coaster. A method that relies on three stations happening to be enough should be able to say so out loud.

The other case belongs to the level view, where the camera is 120 millimetres above the table, 380 millimetres back from a glass, and pointing level at it. This solution does not cluster from there, but the arm spends a good deal of its time there. The first problem measures every glass's shape from that pose, and the camera is sent back to it whenever a group is doubtful. A glass can be completely hidden in that picture too, by a mechanism that has nothing to do with splay and does not answer to the same cure.

From the side, one glass simply stands in front of another and its outline covers it. That is all there is to the mechanism.

The second diagram shows how, in line with the camera, the near glass covers the far one completely. On the left is what the camera returns with a 230-millimetre glass 380 millimetres in front of it, and a 93-millimetre glass 230 millimetres behind that, the two of them in line with the lens. The far glass's own outline is 35 pixels across, and not one of those pixels falls outside the near glass's outline. What comes back is one patch.

Three things follow, and the first is the one that decides what can be done about it.

First, putting the two glasses further apart buys nothing. That pair is covered just as completely 150 millimetres apart as it is 600 millimetres apart. The reason is that as the far glass moves away, its own width in the picture shrinks in exactly the same proportion as its distance from the near glass. The two keep the same relation to each other and the covering does not loosen. What breaks it is turning the camera off the line joining the pair, and only the arm can do that.

Second, the hidden glass is the further one, whatever its height. Looking straight down it is always the shorter glass that loses. Here height does not decide it, position does. And because the near glass is nearer it is magnified, so it can be much the smaller of the two and still cover a great deal. With the 93-millimetre glass in front and the 230-millimetre glass 230 millimetres behind it, the near one is 55 pixels across against the far one's 43, and it hides a quarter of the far glass. It does not hide it completely, because the far glass's rim stands above it, but what it hides is the bottom, meaning the base, and the part of the wall that shows where the glass meets the table.

Third, the blind region does not close. This is what the case costs this method, and it is worth following. The reasoning is the same in kind as it is from above: work out which pieces of table no ray from the lens reached, and report any that could hold the smallest glass of the kind. What differs is the shape of the answer. From above the wedge stops, because the factor that throws an outline outwards is bounded by the glass's own height. From the side there is no such bound. A ray that clears the near glass just under the camera's own height of 120 millimetres lands a very long way behind it, so the blocked strip grows wider the further out it runs instead of ending. The right-hand panel of the diagram shows it. The strip is 85 millimetres wide where it leaves the glass zone, and 152 millimetres wide 650 millimetres beyond the near glass. The narrowest footprint this kind allows is 65 millimetres, so the strip is wide enough to be hiding a glass everywhere along its length. The patch the arithmetic reports is true, and it is nearly useless, because it says only that everything behind this glass and out of the zone was not looked at.

So the honest answer for this view is that the method cannot handle it. It cannot find the hidden glass, for the same reason as before. It cannot bound the place the glass might be in, which is the part it could do from above. And it has no move of its own to make, because it has no feedback loop at all; it runs on the pictures it was handed. What it can do is notice the case and pass it on, and the last part of this section is about where it goes.

A suspect patch is not a failure. It is a request, and it goes to the same place the doubtful groups go: the solution that moves the camera.

There is one difference worth noticing, and it changes that solution's job. A doubtful group has a position, so the viewpoints worth trying are the ones round it. A suspect patch has no object in it, which is the point, so what is wanted is a viewpoint from which the patch itself is visible. That turns choosing the next place to stand from a question about one object into a question about covering a set of regions.

The two cases send that camera-moving solution different requests. A wedge left by the survey is closed by any station far enough round from the one that cast it, and the three stations the survey already visits do it without being asked. A strip left by a level picture cannot be closed from anywhere along the line it lies on, at any distance, so the request is specifically for a pose off that line. This is the arithmetic the camera-moving solution spends its own wedge section on. And because every look costs seconds and the run has a budget, a separate learned method takes the list of patches and asks the one question this method refuses to answer: which of them is likely to have a glass in it.

<!-- section: a-worked-example | A worked example -->

The next part of the page walks through a worked example. This example follows one scene through the whole method. It is described in terms of what happens rather than what is measured.

Six glasses of one kind stand in the zone, with sizes spread right across the range the kind allows. Call them G1 to G6. G1 stands in the middle of the zone, a little to the near side, and is large, meaning tall and wide. G2 is in the far corner of the zone, diagonally out past G1, and is middling in size. G3, G4, and G5 are also middling. G3 is in the near corner on the other side, G4 is out along the far edge away from G2, and G5 is in the near corner on G1's side. Finally, G6 stands on the same diagonal as G1, beyond it, and is the smallest glass the kind allows.

Two relations matter, and neither is accidental. Both are worst cases, chosen on purpose.

The first is that G1 and G2 are the closest pair, and they are only just legally apart, so their centres are barely further apart than the smallest gap this problem promises. They are also lined up with each other along the diagonal running away from the middle of the zone, which is the direction splay throws things.

The second is that G6 is the smallest glass of the kind and it stands beyond the largest one, on the same diagonal. G1 is tall, so splay throws its outline a long way out along that diagonal. G6 is short, so splay barely moves it at all. That is the new case, and it is the one the last part of this example is about.

The camera goes to the middle station, lifted to the survey height and looking straight down at the centre of the zone, so the whole zone is inside the frame and nothing is missing for an uninteresting reason.

First, consider what grouping in the picture returns. G1 stands a short way out from the point directly below the camera, on the diagonal towards the far corner. Splay throws its rim outwards along that diagonal, so in the picture G1's outline does not sit over G1. It leans out past it, towards G2.

G2 stands much further out along the same diagonal, so splay throws its rim outwards too, and by more, because the further a glass stands from the point below the camera, the further splay pushes it. That is where the trouble comes from. G2's outline is pushed so far out that part of it runs off the edge of the picture, and only the near part of it comes back. G1's outline, leaning outwards, reaches the near edge of what is left of G2's. The two outlines touch, so the flood fill hands back one patch where there are two glasses, and the picture shows four blobs for five glasses.

It is worth being careful about why this pair merges, because two outlines can meet by either of two routes and they are worth keeping apart.

The first route needs the frame edge. When two glasses of similar height stand along the same diagonal from the point below the camera, splay pushes both outwards and pushes the further one more, so the gap between them in the picture grows rather than closes, and they meet only when one of them is half out of frame.

The second route does not need the frame edge at all. If the nearer glass is much taller than the further one, splay pushes the near one's outline out by a large factor and the far one's by a small factor, so the gap between them in the picture closes. Whether two outlines meet is therefore a question about the difference in their heights as much as about where they stand.

The merged patch runs from G1's near edge all the way to the corner of the frame, and it is several times wider than any glass of this kind could be. So the picture can tell that something is wrong. What it cannot tell is what is wrong, whether one impossibly wide object or two glasses or three, because the one thing that would separate them was thrown away the moment the scene became pixels.

Next, consider what grouping on the table returns. On the table, G1 and G2 are still nowhere near touching. Take their centre-to-centre gap, subtract half of each glass, and what is left is a strip of bare table several times wider than the grouping distance. The chain cannot cross a strip of nothing, so G1 and G2 come back as two separate groups. Every other pair in the scene stands further apart than that pair, so they are separate too. Five groups come out of the one picture that gave four blobs.

The results show that for all five found glasses, the fitted width is close to its true width and falls inside the kind's range. Four of them, G1, G3, G4, and G5, have a full footprint of dots. G2, however, has a partial footprint, because its top ran off the edge.

Every fit lands very close to the real width. That accuracy is not luck, and it is not the sensor being unusually good. It is what fitting a circle to every dot buys you over taking the two extreme dots as a bounding box, because the extreme dots are exactly the two most likely to be noise and the many ordinary dots outvote them.

G2 still needs its footnote. Part of it is simply not in the picture, so its group is short of dots, and its fitted circle is pulled towards the part that is present. The width it reports is perfectly plausible, and that is precisely the danger. So it is not trusted, and the report says why.

The other stations do not rescue G2, and the reason is worth following. They sit along the same line, one behind the other, so moving to the next station brings G2 closer to being straight below the camera, which is an improvement, but not a large enough one. G2 stands in the far corner of the glass zone, so from every station this survey visits, splay still throws its top past the edge of the frame. G2 is simply the glass this survey sees worst. Its width therefore keeps the partial-footprint flag, and that flag is exactly what this problem asked for: a number, together with an honest statement that the number has not been checked.

So the result is five glasses, five positions, five widths, no merges, and one width flagged as measured from a partial footprint, out of the very pictures in which the older method saw four objects and reported nothing wrong.

But count the rows of that results table again. There are five, and six glasses are standing on the table.

G6 is missing, and nothing above noticed. G1 is tall and wide and stands nearer the point below the camera. G6 is a small glass standing further out along the same diagonal. Splay throws G1's outline a long way out along that diagonal and barely moves G6's, so G1's outline sweeps over G6 and covers it completely. G6 contributes no pixels, so there is no group, no fitted circle, no residual, and no flag.

Look at what the checks had to work with. The range check compares a fitted width against the kind's limits, and there is no fitted width. The residual measures how well a circle explains a group's dots, and there are no dots. The station-agreement rule asks how many stations saw a group, and no group exists to ask about. Every check is a check on something that was found.

Now run the other branch of the method, the one that never looks at the pixels. G1 was found, so its position, its width and its height are all known. Its wedge of hidden directions can be computed, and so can the stretch of that wedge its outline covers. G6's position falls inside that stretch. The arithmetic does not know that G6 is there, because it cannot, but it does know that a patch of table the size of the kind's smallest glass could be standing in that wedge and would have left no trace. So the patch is reported as unsearched.

The second station then settles it. From there the point below the camera has moved, so G1's wedge has swung away, and G6 is plainly visible. The union of the two stations holds all six glasses, and the unsearched patch from the first station is closed by the second.

That is what the arithmetic bought, and it is worth being precise about it. It did not find G6. It made the difference between a run that reports five glasses and a run that reports five glasses and one place it had not looked. The first of those is wrong and silent. The second is incomplete and says so.

Finally, there is the case the method cannot answer. The cell's scene generator will never produce the next case, because it always keeps the glasses a legal distance apart. The method still has to behave sensibly in it, because problem 3 is about exactly this.

A diagram shows where the method stops working. There are three scenes in the picture, in order of difficulty. The first is the case above. The second is recoverable, but not by distance. The third is not recoverable at all.

In the second scene, two glasses stand much closer together than the cell allows, so the strip of bare table between them is narrower than the grouping distance. Now the chain does cross the strip, and they come back as one group. This is where the circle fit earns its place. The circle fitted to that group is about twice as wide as a glass of this kind can be, so the group is rejected as one glass and split in two. Two circles are fitted to the halves, both come out inside the kind's range, and between them they account for every dot. So the answer is two glasses, recovered not by distance, which had already failed, but by the check on the width.

In the third scene the two glasses are actually touching. Now there is no strip of bare table at all, at any grouping distance, so distance has nothing left to say. It is one group, always. The width check can still suspect two, because the group is too wide to be one glass, but suspecting is all it can do, since there is no gap to measure and no distance reasoning left. And with three glasses in a row, the fit cannot even say how many there are, only that there are too many. That case is the handover to problem 3, and it is the honest edge of this method.

<!-- section: where-the-idea-comes-from | Where the idea comes from -->

The next part of the page explains where the idea comes from. None of this was invented for glassware. It is the standard recipe for a robot arm working over a table, and has been for about twenty years. The companion notes write it up as treating point clouds by removing the plane, then clustering. You treat the depth picture as a cloud of points, find the largest flat surface and delete it, because that is the table. Then, you group whatever is left into clumps, where each clump is one object.

It became the default because of what it does not need. It needs no training data, no model file, and no idea what the objects are, so it works on an object the robot has never seen. It also gives positions in real distances straight away, which is what the arm needs anyway.

Five general ideas sit underneath it, and each is worth knowing separately, because four of the five appear in almost every robot that looks at objects on a surface.

The first idea is the pinhole camera model, which turns a pixel and a depth into a point. A pixel, plus a depth reading, plus the camera's pose, is a point in the room. The pixel gives a direction, the depth says how far along it to travel, and the pose says where the ray starts. Reversing the projection in this way is called back-projection, and it is the bridge between everything measured in pixels and everything the arm does in real distances. 

It is used in anything with a depth camera, for building point clouds, for turning a detection into a pose the gripper can go to, and for lining scans up with each other. However, it is rarely right for surfaces a depth sensor reads badly, such as glass, polished metal, black plastic, or anything shiny or see-through. On those surfaces, the depth is missing or wrong, and back-projection then produces confident nonsense. For more on this, you can look up the pinhole camera model, or read Hartley and Zisserman's book, Multiple View Geometry.

The second idea is plane segmentation with RANSAC, which is used for finding and deleting the table. RANSAC stands for random sample consensus. It fits a model to data that is full of stray readings by guessing repeatedly from small samples. For a table, that means picking three points at random, making the plane through them, counting how many other points lie on that plane, and keeping the best plane after a few hundred tries. Removing the biggest plane is how a table-top scene becomes just the objects. 

It is used wherever most of the data does not belong to the model you want, such as finding the ground, fitting lines and circles, stitching pictures together, and lining up point clouds. It is rarely right for scenes with no dominant shape, or where the thing you want is the minority and several models fit equally well. It also does not give the same answer twice, which matters if you need repeatable results. 

The code cell for this solution actually skips RANSAC, because the table is fixed to the arm's frame and measured at startup. This means the plane is a constant, and finding it is a comparison rather than a search. You can find more about this by looking up random sample consensus.

The third idea is Euclidean cluster extraction, which groups points by how close they are. You start from a point, take everything within a chosen distance, take everything within that distance of those, and repeat until nothing new joins. There is one setting and no assumption about what the objects are. Its density-aware cousin is DBSCAN, which adds a minimum-neighbours rule so that scattered noise cannot form clusters of its own. 

This is used for table-top work and bin picking, where objects are separated in space and nobody wants to say in advance what they look like. It is the first thing to try on any depth picture of a scene. It is rarely right for objects that genuinely touch, because distance can only separate things that have distance between them. It is also poor when the right grouping distance differs across the scene, since one number has to serve everywhere. For more on the wider family of these methods, you can look up DBSCAN and cluster analysis.

The fourth idea is least-squares shape fitting, which turns a cloud of dots into a number. You fit a shape to a set of points by minimising an error that can be written as a linear equation. This then has a direct solution and needs no iteration. A fit uses every point rather than the two extreme ones, so one stray dot moves it far less than it moves a bounding box. Its residual, meaning how far the points sit from the fitted shape on average, is a free measure of how well the shape really explains the data. 

This is used for measuring manufactured parts, which are mostly made of circles, lines and planes. It appears throughout metrology and inspection, and anywhere the object's geometry is known in advance. It is rarely right for shapes the model does not describe, because then it returns a confident number together with a large residual that nobody checks. The residual is the guard, and ignoring it is the classic mistake. For more on the geometry, you can look up circular segment. Kåsa's algebraic fit, along with the Pratt and Taubin refinements, are the three standard versions.

The fifth idea is visibility reasoning, which means knowing where you could not have looked. This is the idea that this document gained, and it is the least familiar of the five, although it is old and standard in its own field. 

The idea is that a sensor's view of a scene divides space into three parts rather than two. There is the part it can see and found something in, the part it can see and found nothing in, and the part it could not have seen at all. Treating the third part as if it were the second is the mistake, and it is an easy one, because both of them look like absence in the data. 

Mobile robots meet this constantly and have a standard machinery for it. They keep a map in which every cell is marked free, occupied or unknown, and the unknown cells are what exploration is for. A robot that treats unknown as free drives into walls, and one that treats it as occupied never moves. The same three-way distinction is what turns "I found nothing there" into the two quite different statements "there is nothing there" and "I have not looked there". 

It is used for exploration and mapping, for planning under occlusion, and for any inspection task where saying "clear" carries a cost if it is wrong. It is rarely done analytically, as it is here, because most scenes are too irregular for the hidden region to have a closed form. The usual approach is to divide space into cells and trace rays through them. This cell is the lucky case. The objects are upright solids of revolution on a known plane, and the camera looks straight down, so the hidden region is a union of wedges and can be computed exactly and cheaply. For more on the general form, look up occupancy grid mapping, where the three-way marking is the whole point.

<!-- section: where-it-is-strong-and-where-it-breaks | Where it is strong and where it breaks -->

The next part of the page covers where this method is strong and where it breaks. 

The strengths of this method come from how little it assumes. It needs no training data, no model file and no graphics card, because it does nothing more than group points that are close together, so it works on an object nobody has described to it. It is exact and repeatable, and every step prints something you can read, such as how many points were kept, how many groups came out, how many dots each group held, each fitted width and each residual. When the answer is wrong, one of those goes wrong first, and you can see which. The range check is arithmetic rather than judgement, because it compares a measured width against the kind's own limits, both known before the run, instead of against a threshold somebody tuned until the tests passed. And it answers in real distances from the arm's base, which is what the arm needs anyway. It gets three gifts here that make that easy. The table's height is known, the glasses stand upright so they flatten to neat discs, and there is only one kind of glass on the table at a time.

There is one more strength, and it is the one the second half of this document added. It can say where it has not looked. Almost no perception method can, because almost none of them has a way to distinguish "nothing there" from "could not have seen". This one does, from arithmetic it was already doing, and that turns the most dangerous failure in this problem from an invisible one into a reported one.

The weaknesses divide into one real limit, one that arrives with a later problem, and several assumptions.

The real limit is that touching glasses leave no strip of bare table to find, and the third problem on this page exists to remove that case. A related limit is that two glasses one behind the other, at the same distance from the camera, stay one group, because distance cannot separate things that are not apart in the direction being measured. There, only the fitted width notices.

The second real limit belongs to the blind-region arithmetic rather than to the clustering, and it is worth stating plainly so that nobody expects too much of it. It reasons from the glasses it found, so a glass hidden behind a glass that was itself hidden is outside its reach. In this cell that does not arise, because no glass is hidden from every station, but it is the failure to watch for the day the station layout changes. The arithmetic is also only as good as the fitted widths and heights it is given, so a badly measured glass casts a badly computed wedge. This is the same weakness the line-of-sight test in the third solution has, and for the same reason.

The limit that arrives later is that allowing all four kinds of glass at once widens the acceptable range of widths and weakens the check by exactly as much, since a group that would be impossible for a flute is ordinary for a tumbler. That is covered in the fourth problem.

The assumptions are worth listing because each of them is true in this cell and is still an assumption. First, the method assumes a round footprint, so given a jug it would be the residual that complained. Second, it needs depth readings, and real glassware gives none, because the beam passes through the glass instead of bouncing off it. The cell gets away with this only because the simulator renders the glasses as solid objects. Third, the grouping distance is justified rather than tuned, which is much better, but it still rests on the assumption that things stand apart. One stray dot in the wrong place chains two groups into one, and a table height set a few millimetres too low turns the whole table top into one enormous group. The guards against both are a minimum number of dots per group and DBSCAN's minimum-neighbours rule, which throws away dots with nothing around them. Finally, points above the tallest allowed glass are dropped without comment, and although nothing legal is cut, the report ought to say how many points were dropped at each end, because a sudden change there means something is wrong that nothing else will catch.

<!-- section: where-it-sits-among-the-other-solutions | Where it sits among the other solutions -->

The next part of the page explains where this approach sits among the other solutions. 

It builds on earlier work, because the pixel-to-point arithmetic and the measured table height are already there, and what this adds is the steps that come after them.

It replaces the approach covered on the page about splitting the blob in the picture. That older method attacks the same merged objects by cutting through the mask, and so it treats the symptom of a projection that has already lost the information.

This solution hands two quite different things to the page about moving the camera, which provides the feedback loop this current solution does not have. The first is a doubtful group. This is an object whose measurement cannot be trusted, and the viewpoints worth trying are the ones around it. The second is an unsearched patch. This is a place with no object in it at all, and there the question is not which direction to view an object from, but simply how to get a view of the region. Those two requests want different things from solution three.

And where this solution stops, with two glasses touching, is exactly where problem three starts.

There is one last point about how to read this document, because it is the honest summary of what this solution is. It has two halves that share nothing but their inputs. The first half places what was photographed. The second half reasons about what could not have been photographed, and it looks at no pixels at all. Neither half can do the other's job, and a run that has only the first half will be confidently wrong on exactly the case this problem says to watch hardest.
