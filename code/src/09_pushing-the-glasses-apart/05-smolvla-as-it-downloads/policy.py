"""SmolVLA, exactly as it downloads.

The weights come from ``lerobot/smolvla_base`` and nothing is changed in them.
What this module does is hand the model the three things it takes — a picture,
a sentence and the arm's own state — and give back the run of jaw waypoints it
amounts to. The reading in both directions is ``joining.py``, and it is
applied here so that the whole of the join between this cell and somebody
else's arm sits behind one call.

Three joins at the input had to be decided, and all three are forced by the
model's own configuration rather than chosen freely:

- **The picture.** The model declares three cameras, ``camera1`` to
  ``camera3``, and ``empty_cameras`` is 0, which means a camera that is absent
  from the batch is simply left out rather than padded with a blank. This cell
  has one straight-down view, so it fills ``camera1`` and the other two are
  absent. The array wants to be float 0 to 1, red-green-blue, channels first:
  ``top_view`` already gives RGB, so unlike ``film.py`` nothing is flipped.
- **The sentence.** One line, the same every time, in ``joining.INSTRUCTION``.
- **The state.** Six numbers, which ``joining.to_state`` fills from where the
  jaw is standing. The checkpoint ships no statistics for this input, so there
  is nothing that says what scale it expects; filling it with the jaw's own
  pose under the same reading the actions are read with is the only
  self-consistent answer available.

Loading downloads about 2 GB the first time and then reads it from the cache.
Nothing in the tests comes through here, because a test that needs a download
is not a test.
